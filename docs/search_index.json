Context: At my current company, I worked with large datasets that needed to be balanced to ensure accurate analysis. We needed to create individual-level weights to represent the population properly. Challenge: The datasets were very large, and traditional methods required loading all data into memory, which consumed a lot of resources and took several hours. Action: I developed a SQL query using a post-stratification approach to calculate the individual-level weights. This method dynamically adjusted weights based on demographic variables, making the process simpler and much faster. Outcome: The new query significantly reduced processing time and improved the accuracy of our analysis. It allowed our team to generate more reliable insights and became the standard tool for similar tasks, demonstrating its effectiveness and efficiency. 4.2 How do you resolve conflicts with colleagues? Approach: When resolving conflicts with colleagues, I focus on open communication and understanding. I start by listening to their perspective and concerns without interrupting, which helps me understand their point of view. Action: I then express my own perspective clearly and calmly, focusing on finding common ground. I propose solutions that address both parties’ concerns and seek a compromise. If needed, I involve a neutral third party to mediate and ensure the resolution is fair. Outcome: This approach helps to address the conflict constructively and maintains a positive working relationship. By focusing on communication and collaboration, I’ve successfully resolved conflicts and worked together to achieve our common goals. "],["most-proud-project-influencing-adoption-of-balancing-weights.html", "Chapter 5 Most Proud Project – Influencing Adoption of Balancing Weights", " Chapter 5 Most Proud Project – Influencing Adoption of Balancing Weights S – Situation When I was working on the demographic profile reports, I noticed that some of our panel data sources (like Ibotta receipt sharers) were skewed. Younger, budget-conscious groups were overrepresented, which could mislead clients. At that time, the standard practice across teams was to report raw results only, and many colleagues believed that was “good enough.” T – Task I believed we needed to improve accuracy by applying balancing weights — but first, I had to convince others to adopt this idea and then design a solution that could scale to large datasets used across multiple departments. A – Action I ran side-by-side analyses comparing raw vs. weighted results, showing clearly how the raw version exaggerated some demographics. Presented the findings to my team, explaining in simple terms how weights aligned the panel closer to Census benchmarks. Addressed concerns about complexity by building an automated weighting process that could handle big data efficiently. Influenced adoption by showing that this wasn’t just an academic improvement — it would directly improve client trust in our insights. Set up a monthly refresh pipeline, so the weights stayed current and could be reliably used in all projects. R – Result My colleagues and leadership agreed to adopt balancing weights, and it became the standard methodology across departments for panel data. Today, multiple teams use the weights in their reports, and I continue to maintain the refresh process. I am proud because I not only came up with the idea but also influenced adoption, built the technical solution, and ensured it delivered long-term value. 👉 Why this version is even stronger: Influence: you challenged the status quo and got others on board. Think Big: you turned a one-off fix into a company-wide solution. Ownership: you built and still maintain the monthly refresh. Deliver Results: adoption improved accuracy and client confidence. Quick Pitch: One project I’m most proud of was introducing balancing weights for our panel data. At first, colleagues resisted, but I showed side-by-side results proving that raw data was skewed and built an automated, scalable process. Today, multiple departments use these weights every month, and I still maintain the refresh — it became a company-wide standard that improved accuracy and client trust. "],["amazon-positions.html", "Chapter 6 Amazon Positions 6.1 Economics at Amazon 6.2 Amazon Leadership Principles 6.3 Email from Amazon 6.4 STAR format", " Chapter 6 Amazon Positions 6.1 Economics at Amazon Leadership Principles : Your greatest success in answering the behavioral questions will come from correlating the leadership principles to examples from your work experience. Your examples should highlight the actions you took in these situations, rather than the actions your team or group took. Using “I” statements rather than “we” statements is the best way to think about this (e.g., “The research that I did led to the decision in implementing this process throughout the company.”) A statement like this shows ownership. Be prepared for your interviewer to ask follow-up questions that will dive deeper into your examples. The more interesting and compelling your answers are, the more data points that the interviewer will be able to gather, as well as a clear understanding of your ability to implement your skills in Amazon’s work environment. Be prepared to share multiple strong examples of your professional experience demonstrating each leadership principle. Technical Interview: The technical component of the interview will be focused around a business case study question. The business case study will be modeled off of a previous problem that our economists have solved. The technical evaluation is assessed by way of technical depth and technical breadth – Depth: Diving deeper into the specifics of the model that you use to solve the business related case study question (e.g., inquiring about the different assumptions of the model and what considerations should be accounted for). Breadth: Think of breadth as a toolbox of different econometric methods/approaches specific to your skill set. Breadth shows your ability to appropriately apply other models when answering a problem. You don’t necessarily need to have expertise in every model specific to your skill set, but going back and brushing up on various models is certainly helpful (i.e., knowing the different assumptions of other models and having an understanding of how and when to apply such models.) Keep in mind that when choosing an approach in solving the business case study question that some models will be more appropriate than others (e.g., a diff in diff model requires there to be a certain time series of data, rather than a snapshot at one period in time. If you don’t have that series of data, a diff in diff model would be inappropriate to use.) Other helpful tips: When asked the technical question, be sure to take your time before answering. The technical questions tend to be ambiguous; so thoughtfully considering the question that you have been presented with, and asking follow-up questions will help to provide a clear understanding of the question. When you are answering the case study question, it is helpful to follow this format presenting a clear thought out answer: What type of data should you use? What kind of model should you apply? How should you set up the econometrics? How should you interpret it? *(data, model, econometrics, interpretation). 6.2 Amazon Leadership Principles Earn Trust Listen well. Speak honestly. Show respect. Admit mistakes. Stay humble. Always aim for the best. Ownership Think long term. Protect lasting value. Act for the whole company. Never say “not my job.” Deliver Results Focus on what matters. Deliver quality on time. Overcome setbacks. Never settle. Customer Obsession Leaders start with the customer and work backwards. They work vigorously to earn and keep customer trust. Although leaders pay attention to competitors, they obsess over customers. Invent and Simplify Leaders expect and require innovation and invention from their teams and always find ways to simplify. They are externally aware, look for new ideas from everywhere, and are not limited by “not invented here.” As we do new things, we accept that we may be misunderstood for long periods of time. Are Right, A Lot Leaders are right a lot. They have strong judgment and good instincts. They seek diverse perspectives and work to disconfirm their beliefs. Learn and Be Curious Leaders are never done learning and always seek to improve themselves. They are curious about new possibilities and act to explore them. Insist on the Highest Standards Leaders have relentlessly high standards — many people may think these standards are unreasonably high. Leaders are continually raising the bar and drive their teams to deliver high quality products, services, and processes. Leaders ensure that defects do not get sent down the line and that problems are fixed so they stay fixed. Think Big Thinking small is a self-fulfilling prophecy. Leaders create and communicate a bold direction that inspires results. They think differently and look around corners for ways to serve customers. Bias for Action Speed matters in business. Many decisions and actions are reversible and do not need extensive study. We value calculated risk taking. Dive Deep Leaders operate at all levels, stay connected to the details, audit frequently, and are skeptical when metrics and anecdote differ. No task is beneath them. Have Backbone; Disagree and Commit Speak up respectfully when you disagree, even if it’s uncomfortable. Stand by your convictions and don’t give in just to keep everyone happy. Once a decision is made, fully support it, even if it wasn’t your choice. Do not worry about coming up with examples for the following: Success and Scale Bring Broad Responsibility We’re big and our actions affect the world. Be humble, consider all impacts, and strive daily to improve for customers, employees, partners, and the planet. Leave things better than you found them. Frugality Accomplish more with less. Constraints breed resourcefulness, self-sufficiency, and invention. There are no extra points for growing headcount, budget size, or fixed expense. Hire and Develop the Best Leaders raise the performance bar with every hire and promotion. They recognize exceptional talent, and willingly move them throughout the organization. Leaders develop leaders and take seriously their role in coaching others. We work on behalf of our people to invent mechanisms for development like Career Choice. Strive to be Earth’s Best Employer Create a safe, productive, and fair workplace where people can grow. Lead with empathy, make work enjoyable, and help others succeed—at Amazon or beyond. 6.3 Email from Amazon Reduced Form Causal Analysis (RFCA) RFCA economists specialize in econometric methods to identify causal relationships, handling challenges like selection bias and omitted variables. They use tools such as difference-in-differences, regression discontinuity, matching, synthetic control, and DML, and may conduct surveys or RCTs when needed. They work on program/product evaluations, elasticity estimation, customer behavior analysis, long-term effect prediction, and translating results into business decisions. Communication with non-technical partners is key. In interviews, you’ll be given an ambiguous business case to test your breadth (range of methods you can propose) and depth (ability to implement and explain one method in detail). I suggest asking clarifying questions on the front end before diving into a strategy. Sample Technical Questions How would you measure the effect of a training program for Fulfillment Center associates on performance? How would you help business leaders think about whether they should invest in creating tools to help AWS customers reduce their costs by optimizing the cloud services they use? There’s an intervention X that we tried or are thinking of trying. Leaders want to know if it was or will be a good idea. How would you help them answer that question? Non-Technical Questions: You will also be asked a few situational questions about your experience modeled off of the Amazon Leadership Principles. There is heavy emphasis on this piece as the principles define our company culture and values and the purpose is to assess your scope of experience and impact. I would suggest coming up with a creative example for each principle about a time in your professional experience where you have demonstrated it. Questions will be in the form of “tell me about a time when…” and be prepared to know your stories well as there will be follow up questions! 6.4 STAR format I would suggest formatting your stories in the STAR method for interviewing. The STAR method is a structured manner of responding to a behavioral-based interview question by discussing the specific situation, task, action, and result of what you’re describing. Here’s what it looks like: • Situation - Describe the situation that you were in, or the task that you needed to accomplish. Give enough detail for the interviewer to understand the complexities of the situation. This example can be from a previous job, school project, volunteer activity, or any relevant event. • Task - What goal were you working toward? • Action - Describe the actions you took to address the situation with an appropriate amount of detail, and keep the focus on you. What specific steps did you take? What was your particular contribution? Be careful that you don’t describe what the team or group did when talking about a project. Let us know what you actually did. Use the word “I,” not “we,” when describing actions. • Result - Describe the outcome of your actions and don’t be shy about taking credit for your behavior. What happened? How did the event end? What did you accomplish? What did you learn? Provide examples using metrics or data if applicable "],["amazon-prep-stories.html", "Chapter 7 Amazon Prep Stories 7.1 Sample Questions 7.2 Earn Trust - Tell me about a time you failed and how you handled it. 7.3 Earn Trust - Describe a time you influenced a group despite resistance. 7.4 Ownership – Mastercard Report Redesign 7.5 Ownership - Describe a time you took the lead on a project 7.6 Deliver Results – Blu vs. Non-Blu Analysis 7.7 Deliver results - How have you leveraged data to develop a strategy?", " Chapter 7 Amazon Prep Stories we’ll start building your Amazon Economist interview prep around the Leadership Principles your interviewer mentioned: Earn Trust (primary principle assessed) Ownership Deliver Results Amazon loves STAR format (Situation, Task, Action, Result) — and for more senior/technical roles, sometimes STAR+L (learning) 7.1 Sample Questions 7.1.1 Earn Trust Amazon wants to see how you build credibility, listen attentively, and handle mistakes. What they’re looking for: Willingness to admit mistakes. Ability to recover trust and credibility. Transparency in communication. Sample Questions: Tell me about a time you earned the trust of a difficult stakeholder or teammate. Give an example where you admitted a mistake at work. How did you handle it? How do you make sure your analyses are trusted by both technical and non-technical teams? Describe a time when you had to challenge someone senior to you. How did you do it respectfully? 7.1.2 Ownership Amazon expects leaders to act as long-term owners, not just employees doing their piece. What they’re looking for: Initiative without being told. Thinking beyond your immediate deliverables. Acting in the company’s best interest. Sample Questions: Tell me about a time you took ownership of a project outside your job scope.

What they’re looking for: Persistence under pressure. Resourcefulness in overcoming barriers. Ability to focus on high-impact work. Sample Questions: Tell me about a time you were under a tight deadline and still delivered results. Describe a time when you had to deal with setbacks but still achieved your target. Give an example where you balanced speed vs. accuracy in your work. Tell me about the most impactful analysis or project you delivered. What was the outcome for the business? Tell me about a time you had to meet a tough deadline. Give an example of when you overcame significant obstacles to deliver something. Describe a situation where you had to prioritize competing deliverables. ⚡ Tip for You (Data Scientist angle): For Earn Trust, highlight times you simplified complex data science work for business leaders. For Ownership, bring up how you maintained or fixed pipelines, improved processes, or took on UAT/testing responsibilities even when outside your scope. For Deliver Results, emphasize projects where your analysis directly drove marketing decisions, improved lift, or influenced bottom-line impact. 7.2 Earn Trust - Tell me about a time you failed and how you handled it. Earn Trust - When did you take a risk, make a mistake, or fail? How did you respond, and how did you grow from that experience? A failure to meet a deliverable where you still maintained professional relationships. Tell me about a time when you did not meet a deadline (your interviewer specifically warned this may appear here) S – Situation I was working on a project to develop and revise the quarterly audience framework for our retail furniture client. The framework depended on several input datasets, including a retention exclusion segment that refreshed weekly. T – Task During one cycle, team member noticed my audience counts were inconsistent compared to prior quarters. Since this framework was central for reporting performance and strategy, I had to quickly understand why the numbers were off. A – Action I dug deep into the refresh history and compared historical counts across multiple weeks. Found that in one week, the retention exclusion dataset had refreshed incorrectly, with nearly half the records missing. This explained the sudden drop in counts, since my logic excluded that segment programmatically. Investigated further and discovered that in rare cases, ingestion happened in two parts, causing partial loads. I escalated the issue to the engineering team, sharing detailed logs and examples so they could trace it upstream — they were surprised by the finding. To protect the framework going forward, I redesigned my workflow: first creating stable tables to lock inputs before running the audience logic, so refresh inconsistencies couldn’t break downstream counts. R – Result The issue was confirmed and corrected by engineering. My redesigned process ensured consistent results quarter over quarter. This not only protected the client deliverable but also demonstrated to the team that I take ownership beyond analysis, making sure the entire data pipeline is reliable and future-proof. 👉 Why this works: Ownership → you didn’t just patch your report; you redesigned your process. Dive Deep → you traced the problem to its origin when even engineers weren’t aware. Deliver Results → you kept the quarterly framework on track despite the problem. Earn Trust → you communicated clearly and built credibility by solving a hidden issue. 7.3 Earn Trust - Describe a time you influenced a group despite resistance. S – Situation When I first started building the demographic profile report, one of our key data sources was a panel from Ibotta — people who share receipts. I noticed right away that this was a self-selected group, and it might not represent the full customer base. T – Task My task was to deliver accurate insights to the client, but I was concerned that using raw panel data would mislead them. I wanted the team to apply balancing weights to correct for skewness, but at first there was pushback. A – Action Many teammates felt the raw results were “good enough,” and weighting would make things unnecessarily complicated or make it artificial. To address that, I: Pulled side-by-side comparisons of raw vs. weighted demographics. Showed that the Ibotta panel had over-representation in certain groups (like younger, budget-conscious shoppers), which could distort the insights. Explained in simple terms how weighting aligns the panel closer to Census benchmarks. Built a process to apply weights automatically, so it added little extra work. R – Result After seeing the evidence, the team agreed to adopt weighting in the demographic profile report. The client trusted the updated results and felt more confident using the insights. Weighting has since become standard practice in our reporting whenever panels are involved. 7.4 Ownership – Mastercard Report Redesign S – Situation Our team regularly used a Mastercard report that took around 45 minutes to run. I wasn’t responsible for maintaining this report — it belonged to another part of the team — but I saw that the long runtime slowed everyone down. T – Task Even though it wasn’t my job, I felt ownership to improve it. My goal was to make the process faster so the team could get results more efficiently. A – Action I decided to take initiative and re-design the process. I reviewed the code and data flow to find bottlenecks. Optimized SQL queries and removed unnecessary steps. Reorganized how transformations were done so they ran in a more efficient sequence. Validated the new output carefully to make sure results stayed accurate. R – Result The report runtime dropped from 45 minutes to 5 minutes. This saved hours of waiting every week for the team and made analyses easier to run on-demand. Even though it wasn’t my responsibility, I took ownership to make the process better, and the team still benefits from the faster version today. 7.5 Ownership - Describe a time you took the lead on a project S – Situation While working with our retail furniture client, they revealed that their key business goals were to grow revenue and store footprint. At that time, the quarterly audience framework we used was mainly based on simple segmentation rules. T – Task I needed to refresh the audience framework to better support those goals. My role wasn’t just to produce counts, but to help ensure the framework was meaningful for driving revenue impact. A – Action I suggested a new approach: Combine a propensity model (likelihood of purchase) with a regression model (expected spend) so that the framework could capture both probability of buying and how much they might spend. Prototyped the methodology, showing how the combined score would help prioritize high-value customers. Walked the team and client through the logic in simple terms, so they could see the connection between the model outputs and their business goals. R – Result The approach was adopted in the revised framework. It gave the client a more accurate view of potential revenue from different audience segments, not just reach. This helped them make better-informed marketing decisions and strengthened my role as a thought leader on the project. 👉 Why this works: Shows leadership by influence (you shaped the methodology). Ties directly to business impact (revenue, footprint). Demonstrates Invent and Simplify and Deliver Results, in addition to Ownership. 7.6 Deliver Results – Blu vs. Non-Blu Analysis S – Situation Right after I joined a new team, a retail furniture client, leadership needed a Blu vs. non-Blu audience analysis to evaluate the effectiveness of contracting Blu data. It was urgent, and I was still new to the client’s data environment. T – Task My responsibility was to deliver a clear and accurate analysis showing whether Blu audiences performed better than purchased audiences, even though I had limited time to learn the data structure. A – Action I asked many questions early on — to my manager and teammates — to quickly familiarize myself with the client’s 1P tables, exposure data, and business context. Focused on the key metrics that mattered for leadership: conversion rate and lift. Built the analysis step by step, validating with small samples first to ensure the joins and filters were correct. Kept the design simple and transparent so the results were easy to interpret. R – Result I delivered the analysis within the tight deadline. It clearly showed that Blu segments were performing better than purchased segments, giving the client confidence to continue the contract. For me, it built early credibility on the team — showing that I could deliver accurate, high-impact results quickly, even as a new hire. 7.7 Deliver results - How have you leveraged data to develop a strategy? Dive Deep, Bias for Action, Deliver Results, Think Big S – Situation In the Bid Intelligence project, our campaigns typically treated everyone equally — the same budget allocation regardless of customer value. T – Task I believed this approach wasn’t optimal. High-value customers should get more budget than low-value customers. My task was to propose a strategy backed by data and test whether it would truly work. A – Action I used past purchase data and regression modeling to estimate customer value and predict spend for prospects. Proposed allocating more budget to high-value customers while reducing spend on lower-value ones. To validate, I designed and ran an A/B test: one group with the old “equal treatment” strategy, and one with differentiated budget allocation. R – Result The test showed 15% lower cost and a higher conversion rate when we prioritized high-value customers. This data-driven strategy proved more efficient, and it influenced how the team approached campaign budgeting going forward. 👉 Why this story is strong: Data → Strategy → Action → Results (the full chain). Shows experimentation (A/B testing), which Amazon values a lot. Demonstrates you don’t just analyze — you turn insights into business impact.

I tend to over-explain. Some of my answers included unnecessary details. Instead of giving concise responses, I gave long-winded answers, which may have distracted from the core message. Takeaway for Next Interviews: Practice active listening — let the interviewer finish the full question before responding. Aim for concise, targeted responses first. Add context only if prompted. Use a structured approach (like STAR) to stay on point and avoid rambling. 10.2 Behavioral Questions Asked 10.2.1 Walk me through your resume, focusing on data science. Tip: Highlight key milestones — Ph.D. with quantitative methods, experience with predictive modeling in marketing and operations, Databricks and Snowflake, audience segmentation, A/B testing. Sure. I have a Ph.D. in Economics, where I focused on data analysis and decision-making. After that, I worked as a postdoc, doing research that involved statistics and modeling. Now I’m a data scientist in marketing. I mostly work on measuring campaign performance, building audience segments, and running models to predict customer behavior — like who is likely to convert or come back. I work with large datasets using Python, Spark, and Snowflake. I’ve also worked in emergency and risk planning before, where I helped with data analysis for national security and disaster response. That gave me experience working under pressure and with teams from different areas. 10.2.1.1 Explain your role as Associate Director. As an Associate Director, my main focus is still hands-on data work. I build models, analyze campaigns, and help improve targeting strategies. I support the strategy team by giving them clear insights and data-driven recommendations. I also help set up workflows and make sure data is clean and ready for analysis. I sometimes mentor junior team members, but I don’t manage people directly. 10.2.1.2 Do you prefer R or Python? I prefer Python. I use it for almost all of my work — data processing, modeling, visualization, and automation. I know R too, and I used it more in academic work, but now I mostly use Python with libraries like pandas, scikit-learn, and XGBoost. 10.2.1.3 What is your primary domain? Marketing or something else? Marketing is my main area, especially digital advertising and retail analytics. I’ve worked on projects that involve measuring the impact of campaigns, customer segmentation, and building predictive models for conversions. But I also have experience with risk modeling and operations from my earlier work in defense and disaster planning, so I’m comfortable working in other domains too. 10.2.1.4 Is this work culture fast-paced? Do you deliver value quickly or what? Yes, the environment I work in is definitely fast-paced. Especially in marketing analytics, we often have tight timelines and need to deliver insights quickly — sometimes within a few days. To handle that, I focus on building repeatable workflows and reusable code, so I can move fast without losing accuracy. I try to deliver value early, even if it’s in smaller pieces, and then build on it as more data becomes available or the analysis matures. Pushback: “How do you balance speed with accuracy and quality?” Response: I prioritize building automated workflows and validation checks so the process stays reliable even when moving quickly. I also communicate early about trade-offs — for example, delivering a quick initial insight versus a deeper, fully validated analysis later. That way, stakeholders know what to expect and can make decisions accordingly. 10.2.1.5 Are you involved in any efforts convincing business stakeholders to adopt the models or analysis you do? Yes, I often support those conversations. While I don’t lead client communication directly, I work closely with account leads and strategists to make sure the analysis is clear and actionable. I explain what the model does, why it matters, and how it connects to business goals. Sometimes that means simplifying the story — avoiding technical terms and focusing more on business impact. I also create visuals or summaries that help them understand the “so what.” Pushback: “What if a business stakeholder doesn’t trust the model or analysis?” Response: I focus on transparency and clear communication. I break down the model results into simple terms and highlight the business impact, not just technical details. I’m also open to feedback and ready to adapt the analysis if needed. Sometimes, running a pilot or small test can build trust before a full rollout. 10.2.1.6 Have you been in a situation where you felt like a model was the right way to go, but had to convince a client or manager?** Yes, more than once. One example was when we built a model to predict repeat customers for a furniture brand. I believed the model was strong, but there was hesitation from the strategy team about whether it was too complex or risky to apply. To build trust, I ran a few test cases, shared SHAP values to explain key drivers, and compared model predictions to actual results. That helped them see it wasn’t a “black box” — and that it could actually improve targeting decisions. Eventually, we rolled it out in a controlled way, and it became part of how we shaped future campaigns. Pushback: “What if the client or manager still resists after your explanation?” Response: In that case, I listen carefully to their concerns to understand what’s blocking them — whether it’s technical, business risk, or something else. Then I try to address those specific concerns, maybe by providing more evidence, simplifying the approach, or proposing a compromise solution. If resistance remains, I stay collaborative and patient, recognizing that change can take time. 10.2.2 Model Related Questions: 10.2.2.1 Discuss a model you did before? Walk me thru the steps, how I built the model, how I evaluated the model. I try to explain a look alike model Look-Alike Model — STAR Format Answer Situation: I was working with a retail client who wanted to grow their customer base by finding new prospects similar to their best existing customers. The challenge was to identify these “look-alike” prospects using available data. Task: My task was to build a predictive model that could distinguish high-value customers from the general population and then use that model to find new potential customers to target. Action: I gathered multiple data sources, including purchase history, demographic info I created meaningful features, such as life stage indicators, closeness to stores I labeled the best customers as positives and the rest – non buyers, or sample from population – as negatives to create a classification dataset. I trained a gradient boosting model (XGBoost) to learn the patterns that separate high-value customers from others. To evaluate, I used AUC-ROC and precision-recall metrics, ensuring the model performed well in identifying true positives without too many false alarms. I also applied SHAP values to explain the model’s predictions, helping the client understand what drives customer similarity. Finally, I scored a new audience with the model and worked with the marketing team to apply these look-alike segments in campaigns. Result: The model helped improve targeting efficiency, leading to higher conversion rates in campaigns. The client appreciated the transparent explanations from SHAP analysis, which increased their trust in the model. This project became a key part of their marketing strategy for prospecting. 10.2.2.2 Can you elaborate what is lookalike model and objective of the model, what you are trying to predict? What is a Look-Alike Model? A look-alike model is a type of classification model used to find new people who are similar to a group of known, high-value users — for example, loyal customers, repeat buyers, or people who completed a conversion. Objective of the Model The goal is to help marketing teams expand their audience by targeting new users who “look like” their best customers — based on behavior, demographics, or other data signals. In other words, we want to predict which non-customers are most likely to become valuable customers, based on patterns we’ve learned from existing ones. What the Model is Predicting The model is trained to predict a binary outcome: 1 = high-value customer (like someone who purchased recently or frequently) 0 = general population or lower-value customer Once trained, the model gives a score or probability for each person in a larger population — showing how likely they are to resemble a top customer. These high scorers become the “look-alike audience” for targeting. 10.2.2.3 How do you overcome overfitting? Great question! Here’s a simple, structured answer you can use in an interview to explain how you handle overfitting, tailored to the kind of modeling work you do: 10.2.3 How do you overcome overfitting? Overfitting happens when a model performs well on training data but poorly on new or unseen data. I use a few key strategies to prevent it: Train-Test Split / Cross-Validation I always split my data into training and test sets, and often use cross-validation to make sure the model performs consistently across different folds. Feature Selection / Regularization I reduce noisy or irrelevant features, especially when working with high-dimensional data like 400 binary features. I also use regularization techniques (like L1/L2 or tree-specific ones like max_depth and min_child_weight in XGBoost) to penalize overly complex models. Simplifying the Model I avoid overly deep trees or too many estimators in ensemble models. Sometimes a simpler model, like logistic regression, can generalize better than a complex one. Early Stopping In models like XGBoost, I use early stopping based on validation performance to avoid training too long and fitting to noise. Monitor Test Performance I always compare training and test set metrics — if the training accuracy is much higher, that’s a red flag. I may tune hyperparameters or simplify the model based on that. 10.2.3.1 How do you detect overfitting? 10.2.3.1.1 Short Answer (Interview-Ready) I detect overfitting by comparing performance between the training set and the validation or test set. If the model performs much better on training data than on unseen data — like high accuracy or AUC in training but much lower on test — that’s a clear sign of overfitting. 10.2.3.1.2 Expanded Answer (If You Want to Add a Bit More) To detect overfitting, I: Split the data into training and validation/test sets. Compare model metrics — like accuracy, AUC, precision-recall — across both sets. If I see a large gap, like 95% accuracy on training and only 75% on test, it likely means the model is too complex and is fitting noise in the training data. I may also use learning curves to visually inspect training vs. validation loss over time. 10.2.3.2 What do you do when you detect overfitting?”* (that’s a likely follow-up)? When I detect overfitting, I take steps to simplify the model and improve generalization: Simplify the Model: I reduce complexity — like lowering the depth of decision trees or reducing the number of features, especially in high-dimensional data. Use Regularization: I apply techniques like L1 or L2 regularization, or tune parameters like max_depth, min_child_weight, or subsample in XGBoost to control complexity. Add Early Stopping: I monitor validation loss and stop training when performance starts to drop, to prevent the model from learning noise. Cross-Validation: I use k-fold cross-validation to make sure the model performs well across different subsets of the data. More Data or Feature Engineering: If possible, I add more training data or improve feature quality, which helps the model learn more general patterns instead of memorizing. Awesome! Let’s walk through a real example from your past work — we’ll use your look-alike model since it’s relevant, and frame it around how you detected and fixed overfitting. 10.2.3.3 Live Example: Detecting &amp; Fixing Overfitting in a Look-Alike Model Context: I built a look-alike model to identify new prospects who resembled high-value customers for a retail furniture client. The model used hundreds of features — including web behavior, purchase categories, and demographics — and I trained it using XGBoost. How I Detected Overfitting During evaluation, I noticed the training AUC was very high (around 0.95), but the test AUC dropped to around 0.78. That gap suggested the model was overfitting — learning patterns specific to the training set instead of generalizable signals. I also plotted learning curves, which showed the training loss continuing to drop while the validation loss flattened — another red flag. What I Did to Fix It Regularization: I added more regularization to the model by adjusting lambda, alpha, and min_child_weight in XGBoost to reduce model complexity. Feature Pruning: I had over 400 binary features from categorical sources. I used feature importance and SHAP values to remove low-signal features, which helped reduce noise. Cross-Validation: I switched to 5-fold cross-validation to get a more stable estimate of performance and avoid accidental bias from one random train-test split. Early Stopping: I enabled early stopping based on validation AUC, so training would stop once performance plateaued. Result After tuning, the model achieved a balanced AUC of around 0.84 on both train and test sets — much better generalization. The final model was used to score and activate new audience segments in media campaigns, and the client saw improved conversion rates from those segments. 10.2.3.4 Any data stratification technique that you can use to overcome overfitting? Yes — stratified sampling is a helpful technique, especially when the target classes are imbalanced. Instead of randomly splitting the data, I use stratified train-test splits or stratified cross-validation, which ensures that the proportion of classes (like 1s and 0s) stays consistent across training and test sets. This helps the model learn more balanced patterns and prevents overfitting to the dominant class. For example, in a look-alike model where positive examples (high-value customers) are rare, stratification helps make sure both the train and validation sets have similar class distribution — which leads to more reliable evaluation and less risk of the model overfitting to the majority class. StratifiedKFold or train_test_split(..., stratify=y) in scikit-learn 10.2.3.5 Any other ways to simplify a model (to reduce overfitting)? Use a Simpler Algorithm: If the problem doesn’t require complex modeling, I may use logistic regression or decision trees instead of XGBoost or random forests. Simpler models are easier to interpret and less prone to overfitting. Limit Feature Interactions: In tree-based models, I can limit max_depth or number of leaves, so the model doesn’t learn very specific combinations that might not generalize. Reduce Feature Count: I remove highly correlated or low-variance features, or use dimensionality reduction (like PCA) when it makes sense. This reduces noise and helps the model focus on the strongest signals. Bin Continuous Variables: For some models, turning numeric variables into bins or categories (like income ranges or age groups) can help reduce sensitivity to outliers and improve generalization. Ensemble Simpler Models: Sometimes, I combine a few weaker learners (like shallow trees) rather than fitting a very complex single model. This is the idea behind boosting and bagging — but I still control the complexity of base learners. 10.2.3.6 Are you using cross validation method? Yes, I often use cross-validation to get a more reliable estimate of model performance — especially when I’m tuning hyperparameters or working with limited data. The most common method I use is k-fold cross-validation, usually with 5 folds. It helps me make sure the model performs consistently across different subsets of the data and reduces the chance of overfitting to a single train-test split. When I have imbalanced classes, I use stratified k-fold, so each fold keeps the class distribution balanced — this is especially important in classification tasks like look-alike modeling. 10.2.3.7 What are you looking for when you compare multiple classification models? In short: I compare models based on performance metrics, generalization, interpretability, and how well they support business goals. Long version When I compare classification models, I look at a mix of performance metrics, interpretability, and stability: 1. Model Performance I start with AUC-ROC, precision, recall, and F1-score, depending on the problem. For imbalanced data, I pay close attention to precision-recall curves and false positive/negative rates. 2. Generalization Ability I compare train vs. validation/test performance to check for overfitting. Cross-validation results help me see if a model is stable across different data splits. 3. Interpretability I consider how easy it is to explain the model to business stakeholders. If the client needs transparency, I may prefer logistic regression or decision trees over black-box models. Some clients or teams want to understand how the model makes decisions — especially in regulated industries or for high-stakes use cases. In those situations, I prefer interpretable models like: Logistic Regression: Easy to explain — each feature has a coefficient that shows how it increases or decreases the probability of the outcome. This is great for understanding the effect of individual variables. Decision Trees: They show clear rules like “if age &gt; 30 and income &gt; 50K → likely to convert.” Clients can easily follow the logic. In contrast, black-box models like XGBoost or neural networks may perform better but are harder to explain. In those cases, I may use SHAP values to help visualize feature impact and make the model more transparent. 4. Training Speed &amp; Scalability If I’m working with large datasets or in a pipeline that needs frequent retraining, I check model training time and resource use. 5. Business Impact Finally, I think about which model gives the most useful and actionable results. Even a slightly lower-performing model might be better if it’s easier to implement or explain. 10.2.3.8 What is ROC curve? Here’s a clear, simple answer you can use in an interview: What is an ROC curve? The ROC curve (Receiver Operating Characteristic curve) is a graph that shows the performance of a classification model at different thresholds. It plots: True Positive Rate (a.k.a. recall or sensitivity) on the Y-axis False Positive Rate on the X-axis What it tells you: It helps you understand how well the model separates the positive and negative classes. A model that’s closer to the top-left corner is better. A random guess would follow the diagonal line. AUC (Area Under Curve): The AUC score summarizes the curve — AUC = 1.0 → perfect model AUC = 0.5 → no better than random I often use ROC-AUC to compare models — it’s especially useful when classes are balanced. 10.2.3.9 Have you used Lift charts? Yes, I’ve used Lift charts when evaluating classification models, especially in marketing use cases like targeting and audience scoring. 10.2.3.9.1 What is a Lift Chart? A Lift chart shows how much better the model performs compared to random targeting. It plots the cumulative gain or conversion rate when targeting top-ranked individuals (based on model scores), compared to a baseline (random selection). 10.2.3.9.2 Why I Use It It helps answer: “If I target the top 10% of people scored by my model, how much more likely are they to convert compared to random?” In marketing, this is very actionable — it helps decide how many people to include in a campaign to get the best return. 10.2.3.9.3 Example from My Work In my look-alike model, I used lift charts to evaluate how well the model ranked new prospects. The top decile (top 10%) of scores showed 3–4x higher conversion compared to the baseline — that gave the client confidence in using the model for targeting. Sometimes we need to explain how we get to find the model results/scores. Have you worked on a case where you want to help business stakeholders understand what is driving predictions. In a scenario, outcome is whether responding campaign and predictor is a binary variable whether opened an email or not. How do you interpret a feature coefficient in a logistic regression? Is it causal or correlation? Is shap value a causation or correlation? When interpreting the coefficient in shap, you said “people who opened the email are more likely to respond to campaign? You sounded more of a causation. How would you rephrase it to sound more like correlation? In a black box model and trying to understand what features are important, rather than using SHAP values, just using the model? How do you evaluate if feature is important outside of SHAP values? Can you use the model and feature set to As data scientists, we collaborate with business stakeholders and we have to do a lot of convincing. We communicate model performances and how model works with them. Let’s say we are building a same response model. We are predicting who will respond to campaign and stakeholders are interested in increasing the response rate. Stakeholders say we have our way to do it. How would you prove model is bringing value to the organizations? How can you set up a test/experiment and show the model is better?

Values hands-on project discussion – wanted to learn deeply about my experience and applications of data science. Open-ended intro prompt – important to tailor intro to highlight relevant strengths and standout projects. Thank you so much for taking the time and giving me this opportunity to speak with you. I’m a hands-on data scientist with over five years of experience across academic and industry settings, focusing on the economic and machine learning perspectives of data science. I hold a Ph.D. in Economics, with a specialization in econometric and microeconometric modeling. I also completed a one-year postdoctoral research position at the University of Kansas, where I worked on policy-driven research projects. After academia, I transitioned into the industry and have been working in the marketing science domain for the past three years. In my current role, I analyze consumer behavior using diverse data sources including web search data, location-based data, transactional data, and TV viewership data. I apply both supervised learning techniques—such as churn prediction, similarity modeling, and lookalike modeling—as well as unsupervised methods for customer segmentation and persona development. I also have expertise in causal inference techniques, including difference-in-differences and propensity score matching, to evaluate marketing effectiveness. One area I enjoy is integrating return path data, population data, and first-party purchase data to study how media exposure influences consumer behavior. Additionally, I’ve developed scalable scripts—especially in SQL and Python—to mimic the functionality of balancing-weight libraries like those in R, enabling them to run efficiently on large datasets with millions of observations, where traditional methods fall short. In short, I bring a mix of econometrics, machine learning, and scalable engineering approaches to help businesses make data-driven marketing decisions. 11.0.1.1 Describe a data science project you are most proud of: The problem the project aimed to solve, The methods used, The outcome/results of the project 11.0.1.1.1 📊 Project Highlight – Value-Based Bidding Algorithm Context: In a marketing campaign, all users were previously treated equally with the same budget allocation (e.g., $10 per user), regardless of their likelihood to convert or spend. Problem: The uniform budget approach didn’t account for user differences in potential value, possibly leading to inefficient spending. Solution: Developed a customized, value-based bidding algorithm: Estimated each user’s customer lifetime value (CLV) using past purchase history. Assigned personalized user budgets based on expected value: Lower expected value → lower budget Higher expected value → higher budget Method: Designed and implemented an A/B test: Control group: flat, equal-budget treatment Test group: value-based personalized bidding Outcome: The value-based bidding group showed higher conversion rates and better return on ad spend (ROAS). The project was successful, measurable, and high-impact. Additional Note: Emphasized your enjoyment and skill in causal inference and campaign lift analysis, which were used to validate the results. 11.0.1.2 Can you speak a little bit about how you deployed a model? Whether it’s the example you just walked through or another one — what systems are you using, and how do you deliver the results to the end user? Sure. For the value-based bidding project, we worked with The Trade Desk. After estimating the model predictions for user-level bids, we had to follow The Trade Desk’s specific data formatting and submission rules to push the data into their platform. More generally, in our day-to-day workflow, we use tools like Snowflake and Databricks. Once a model reaches a stable and mature state, I typically deploy it within the Databricks environment. The outputs are then used to refresh our audience segments on a quarterly basis, ensuring that targeting is aligned with the most recent model predictions. 11.0.1.3 Can you speak a little bit about the team you currently work with? Is it just you? Are there other data scientists or data engineers? What’s the makeup of that group? Sure. I’m part of a Marketing Science team within an agency, which includes around 20 data scientists in total. However, our structure is client-based, so we typically work independently to support specific client accounts. For example, I currently support two different clients, and while I am the only data scientist assigned to those accounts, I collaborate closely with a small team that usually includes business owners, account managers, and data solution stakeholders—around five people total per account. My focus is on hands-on modeling, data analysis, and execution, while client communication and strategic interpretation of the work are usually led by the business owners or account leads. they dont deploy models they work with data engineers, clean, prep, premodel, deploy model etc 11.0.1.4 Can you talk through a time when you had to deliver an analysis or outcome that conflicted with a stakeholder’s expectations? How did you handle that? Yes, this definitely happens, and I think it really comes down to clear communication and collaborative validation. When I deliver results that differ from what a stakeholder expected, my first step is to review the analysis thoroughly—double-check the code, data transformations, and assumptions to ensure there’s no technical error on my side. I also try to understand what expectations the stakeholder had and why they may have interpreted the data differently. In these situations, I often conduct a sensitivity analysis or robustness checks to confirm that the findings are solid. Once I’m confident in the results, I work to bring the stakeholders into the process—discussing why the outcome might differ from their intuition and what factors in the data might explain the discrepancy. For example, I work with a retail furniture company where recent macroeconomic changes, such as those following a national election, affected consumer behavior. Stakeholders had strong expectations based on last year’s trends, but those patterns didn’t hold this year. We had to rethink our audience creation strategy to reflect new economic realities, rather than relying solely on past behavior. So, in short, I try to balance the technical findings with the business context and stakeholder insights, knowing that their perspective often includes valuable domain knowledge I might not initially see in the data alone. GOOD Collaborative mindset – You emphasized communication and validation, which are key when managing expectation gaps. Technical caution – You mentioned rechecking your code and doing sensitivity analysis, showing scientific thinking and integrity. Respect for stakeholder expertise – You acknowledged their viewpoint and gave a real-world example (e.g., macroeconomic shifts post-election), which shows business awareness. Adaptability – You described adjusting audience strategies due to changing conditions, which reflects flexibility and contextual reasoning. 🔧 Areas to Improve Structure – The original answer was a bit disorganized and repetitive, with filler phrases like “yeah,” “I guess,” and circular thoughts that distracted from the key message. Confidence – Phrases like “maybe,” “I think,” or “let me think” made it sound unsure at times. A more assertive tone (“Here’s what I usually do…”) builds credibility. Focus – Initially, you didn’t give a concrete example right away. Starting with the retail furniture case could anchor the listener before diving into your thought process. 11.0.1.5 What interested you most about the job posting, and why did you choose to apply? Great question. I’ve been working remotely for the past three years at my current company, which is based in New York. It was my first industry role after academia, and I’ve gained a lot of hands-on experience there—particularly in applied data science for marketing. What stood out to me about this opportunity at ADP is, first, the Chicago location. I’m based here, so the possibility of a hybrid setup really appealed to me. Second, ADP’s scale and reputation were a major draw. It’s a large, well-established company, and I see that as a strong platform for career growth and long-term learning. I’m also interested in working in a new domain where I can apply what I’ve learned in marketing science but also expand into broader data science applications. So, overall, the role felt like a natural next step for both professional development and alignment with where I want to grow. 11.0.1.6 What questions do you have for me? What can I help you understand? Thanks—yes, I’ve discussed some of this with the recruiter, but I’d love to get your perspective. I understand this is a Lead Data Scientist position and an individual contributor role within a team of around seven data scientists, reporting to you. I’d like to better understand how the team fits within the larger organization. Specifically: How is work prioritized or aligned with business goals? Are you structured more like an internal consulting function, or do you work directly with internal business units? Do you operate more like an internal product/analytics team, or are there client-facing components? Coming from an agency setting, I’m used to supporting external clients directly, often as the only data scientist on the account, working closely with non-technical marketing stakeholders. So, I’d love to get a sense of how cross-functional collaboration looks in your team—especially around communication with business partners or product owners. ADP – Data Science Team Overview (Manager’s Response) Business Unit Context: The role sits within ADP’s Human Resources Outsourcing (HRO) business unit. HRO provides technology + services. For example, not just payroll software, but also payroll associates who manage it for clients. Two subunits: Total Source (PEO) – Full-service HR outsourcing (payroll, benefits, workers’ comp, recruiting, etc.). Comprehensive Services – Modular services (e.g., payroll or benefits), where clients choose specific functions. Team &amp; Role Setup: The data science team supports internal stakeholders, not external clients. The team focuses on enabling better decision-making and operations within the HRO business unit. Currently 7 data scientists; this role would be the 8th, reporting directly to Kate Lindsay. Team collaborates with: Data engineers Business intelligence analysts Product managers (who lead agile/scrum processes) Key Focus Areas &amp; Projects: Pricing Optimization: Models to recommend appropriate annual price increases for clients, based on service usage and churn risk. Churn Prediction: Identifying clients at high risk of leaving, so the team can proactively retain them. Benefits Participation Forecasting: Predicting employee enrollment in health plans. Higher participation is tied to client satisfaction and retention. Workload Balancing (WorkPod Project): Monitoring workloads of client service associates to ensure fair and efficient allocation across clients. Team Dynamics: Data scientists work independently or sometimes in small collaborative groups (e.g., splitting models on a single pricing project). Work is embedded within cross-functional teams, each oriented around a product or business problem. She explained that most of their data is internal, coming from ADP’s own systems and client interactions. However, for specific areas like workers’ compensation insurance, they do integrate some third-party data. In the case of workers’ comp: A claim can evolve in unpredictable ways—doctor’s bills, salary replacement, legal involvement, etc. To forecast how claims may develop, they partner with external vendors who provide projections based on their expertise and datasets. These projections help them manage risk and plan for the potential financial impact of claims. So while the majority of their analytics work is based on first-party data, third-party data supplements the modeling in high-stakes or uncertain areas like insurance claims. 11.0.1.7 GenAI at DP They haven’t deployed GenAI models to production yet within her team, but have explored its potential in a couple of key areas: Feature Creation from Unstructured Text Associates enter free-text notes on client interactions. They explored using GenAI to analyze these notes and infer client sensitivities (e.g., price vs. service-driven concerns). Enhanced Context for Retention Models For clients flagged as high churn risk, they experimented with GenAI-generated summaries to help internal users understand context and potential next steps. Additionally: Other teams at ADP are actively focused on GenAI. Her team sometimes partners with them to learn from their innovations and integrate relevant solutions where it makes sense. So, while it’s still early-stage in their specific unit, GenAI is a growing area of interest and experimentation across the company. 11.0.1.8 🧠 Your Observation: This last part of the conversation revealed some important context about one of their internal-facing data science initiatives. Here’s a quick summary and reflection on your question and her response: You asked whether the last project she mentioned—about managing associate workload—was more like people analytics, since it involved understanding if employees are getting overwhelmed. 👍 This was a smart observation—you noticed a shift in focus from external client analytics to internal workforce insights. 11.0.1.8.1 👩‍💼 Her Response Summary: It’s not quite people analytics or workforce optimization in the traditional sense. The goal is to measure work units consistently using internal data (e.g., Salesforce cases). Since no two cases are the same, they worked on defining: What counts as a unit of work How much time/effort it typically takes How to measure and aggregate workload The ultimate use is decision support: For example, helping leadership decide where to allocate new hires to balance workloads across teams. 11.0.1.8.2 Why This Matters for You: If you join their team: You’ll work on a diverse range of problems—from churn modeling to workload quantification. You’ll need to think creatively about data structure and definitions, especially in operational contexts that don’t have standardized metrics. Communication will be key since you’re translating unstructured or noisy inputs (like Salesforce activity logs) into actionable insights. 11.0.2 Third Round with two Directors 11.0.2.1 what is the project or the deliverable that you’re most proud of? Project You’re Most Proud Of: Propensity + Spend Estimation + Clustering for Targeting Strategy S – Situation: A retail client was investing heavily in upper-funnel marketing but lacked a way to prioritize media toward consumers most likely to drive net-new revenue. Their goal was not just to increase conversions but to acquire net-new customers who would bring in meaningful future spend. T – Task: I was tasked with designing a data science pipeline that could: Identify high-propensity net-new customers, Estimate their future spend value, and Segment them into actionable tiers to guide media targeting and budget allocation. A – Action: I started by building a propensity model to predict the likelihood of conversion for net-new users only, using features from demographic data, behavioral signals, and geographic location. For those with high purchase propensity, I layered on a spend regression model to forecast expected revenue per user. Then, I multiplied propensity × expected spend to derive expected value per ID. Finally, I applied K-means clustering to group users into value-based segments (e.g., high-expected revenue vs. mid- and low tiers). These clusters informed bid strategy, creative investment, and audience prioritization in activation platforms (e.g., heavier bids and premium creative for the top-tier segments). R – Result: This segmentation framework helped shift marketing investment toward high-value net-new customers, rather than broadly targeting all high-propensity IDs. The client saw a 20–25% lift in ROAS and a measurable increase in net-new customer count during the campaign period. The method was adopted as a audience framework for future campaigns, reinforcing the connection between model outputs and strategic execution. I’m especially proud of this project because it didn’t just predict who would buy — it helped the client predict who mattered most for net-new revenue growth, and operationalize that insight through smarter media decisions. 11.0.2.2 After you’ve built a model that works, how do you keep it working over time? Even if you haven’t directly owned full MLOps infrastructure, you can still give a strong answer by framing your experience around monitoring, retraining, and collaborating with engineers—while signaling you’re eager to go deeper into formal MLOps. Even if you haven’t directly owned full MLOps infrastructure, you can still give a strong answer by framing your experience around monitoring, retraining, and collaborating with engineers—while signaling you’re eager to go deeper into formal MLOps. Here’s how to respond based on your experience with some smart framing: Start with What You’ve Done: In my recent roles, I’ve primarily focused on developing and evaluating predictive models that directly inform marketing strategies—for example, lookalike targeting, lift analysis, spend prediction, or customer clustering. While I haven’t owned end-to-end deployment pipelines, I’ve been closely involved in the post-model launch stage, especially in terms of monitoring and evaluating ongoing performance. Then give a concrete example, such as: For a repeat purchase prediction model, I set up ongoing tracking for feature drift and monitored how model precision/recall changed over time as we acquired new customers or updated creative strategies. We scheduled re-evaluation every X weeks and flagged meaningful changes in input distribution—for instance, a sudden shift in channel mix or category engagement—which might require retraining. Show You Understand What Maintenance Involves: From a maintenance perspective, I’ve learned it’s critical to define success metrics up front—whether it’s conversion lift, revenue, or classification accuracy—and make those metrics part of a regular performance review cadence. I’ve worked on documenting feature assumptions, saving training data snapshots, and validating that scoring environments match training logic—even when model code gets handed off to an engineering team.” Describe Deployment &amp; Collaboration: While I haven’t deployed models into production pipelines directly via tools like MLflow or Vertex AI, I’ve collaborated with engineers and product managers to translate models into production-ready scoring logic, including writing SQL/Python scripts for batch scoring or API handoff. I’ve also tested outputs and helped debug scoring mismatches after handoff. Optional Ending to Show Growth Mindset: I’m currently learning more about formal MLOps practices—CI/CD for models, monitoring tools, model registries—because I see how important it is to scale impact and keep models trustworthy in the long run.” TL;DR Key Talking Points: You can build your answer around these themes: Monitoring – You’ve tracked model performance post-launch (drift, KPIs). Retraining cadence – You’ve been involved in planning or suggesting when and why to retrain. Collaboration – You’ve worked with engineers to translate models into production use. Documentation &amp; validation – You understand the importance of reproducibility and matching training vs. scoring logic. Learning mindset – You’re building toward deeper MLOps integration. 11.0.2.3 I’m curious about your experience with LLMs. Can you walk through that project—what was the problem, what did you build, and what was the impact? Yes, I started using LLMs about a year ago for a project I’m still maintaining. The core problem was that our demographic profile reports—though rich in data—were difficult to interpret, especially for non-technical stakeholders. These reports include over 45 Excel tabs per audience segment, covering everything from household composition, income, auto ownership, interests, and financial attributes, along with visualizations and comparative metrics. While powerful, the reports were overwhelming to digest, especially when comparing multiple audience segments or benchmarking them against the general U.S. population. So, I built an automated LLM-powered workflow that summarizes the key insights for each segment. Here’s how it works: team members define a segment name in Snowflake, and the automated pipeline pulls all the demographic and behavioral data, runs profiling logic, and generates the full Excel report. Then, the LLM API is used to interpret the summary statistics and generate a concise, one-page natural language insight report. The output is tailored based on the segment’s business context—e.g., if it’s an e-commerce or furniture company, the LLM interprets results in a relevant tone. This solution has been a huge time-saver and adoption booster. Instead of digging through 45 sheets, non-technical users—like business solutions experts and client-facing teams—can quickly grasp how a segment over- or under-indexes across key attributes. It bridges the gap between deep data and clear, actionable insight. Ultimately, this tool helps business decision-makers more easily understand their target audiences and make faster, more informed choices about campaign strategies, personalization, or segment prioritization.

Shifting from project-based work to building a scalable measurement product (e.g., uplift modeling as productized service). Strong emphasis on real-time readiness, cleanroom infrastructure, and end-to-end measurement integration. 12.0.1.2 do you tell me something about yourself? Yes, definitely. I’ve been working as a Data Scientist for the past three years at Horizon Media, primarily within the marketing domain. I hold a Ph.D. in Economics, which has given me a strong foundation in causal inference models. Over the last three years, I’ve used tools such as Python, PySpark, SQL, and R to analyze consumer behavior across a variety of clients and datasets—including measurement data. My work has largely focused on pre-campaign analysis: identifying optimal targeting segments, optimizing segment performance, analyzing consumer behavior, and running customer segmentation. I’ve also built predictive models to help scale targeting strategies. Additionally, I’ve developed engineering scripts using SQL-based weighted sampling methods to create balanced samples across datasets, ensuring representativeness of target populations. In a similar effort, I engineered scalable scripts to create balancing weights for large datasets—addressing selection bias due to non-random sampling of the U.S. population. I’ve also applied causal inference models to estimate marketing effectiveness where needed—though our agency has a separate team that primarily handles post-campaign measurement. I’m familiar with using LiveRamp data, as well as GCP logs and trade test data, to run marketing effectiveness and conversion analyses—particularly broken down by demographic groups based on population data. So overall, my experience blends statistical modeling, engineering, and applied marketing analytics with a strong focus on rigorous methodology and scalable implementation. Concise version I’m a data scientist with a Ph.D. in economics and three years of hands-on experience in marketing analytics at Horizon Media. My focus is on pre-campaign strategy—segmenting audiences, analyzing consumer behavior, and building predictive models to improve targeting efficiency. I work extensively with Python, PySpark, SQL, and R, and I’ve also developed weighted sampling and balancing scripts to ensure data representativeness across large, non-random datasets. I’ve applied causal inference methods to estimate marketing lift when needed, and I’m familiar with using LiveRamp, GCP logs, and trade test data for demographic conversion analysis. I enjoy bridging rigorous methodology with business needs to deliver scalable, impactful insights. 12.0.1.3 Can you tell me about the methodology you used to create balancing weights for panel data to remove bias? Sure, happy to explain. We work with datasets that vary widely in size—from about 10 million to over 250 million records—including transaction data, TV viewership, and web search activity. These datasets often have demographic biases depending on how they were collected. For instance, some might overrepresent younger users or underrepresent rural areas. To correct for these imbalances and make the datasets more representative of the national population, I apply post-stratification weighting. The idea is to assign weights to individual records based on how well they align with known population benchmarks—like age, gender, income, or region—so that the aggregate more closely matches something like the U.S. Census distribution. For smaller datasets, I’ve used R—specifically the anesrake package, which performs iterative proportional fitting (also known as raking). But that approach doesn’t scale well for big data. So for larger datasets, I built a custom SQL-based solution that implements post-stratification logic directly at scale. It calculates the ratio between sample distribution and the target distribution within each stratum and assigns a weight accordingly. This allows us to run the process on tens or hundreds of millions of records efficiently, using distributed computing environments like Spark or Snowflake. The result is a set of balanced weights that we apply to downstream analyses, like modeling or summary stats, which helps mitigate bias and improve representativeness. 12.0.1.4 I also noticed on your résumé that you mentioned measuring and optimizing campaign performance. Would you mind sharing more details about those projects? Were you doing media exposure analysis, or perhaps something like a marketing mix model? That’s what I was assuming. Also, you mentioned that your strategy led to a 10% increase in conversion rate. Could you walk me through how you reached that conclusion? I’d love to hear more about the study and methodology you used there. reponse These were all different projects, but they fall under the broader theme of campaign performance optimization. I’ll start with one specific experiment I led last year, which was part of a new initiative. Typically, when launching a campaign, all individuals are treated equally in terms of bid allocation—regardless of their likelihood to convert or their expected return. The bidding algorithm usually assigns a flat bid, say $10 or $20, based on overall budget constraints, without differentiating between users. To improve this, I developed a predictive algorithm to estimate both: The likelihood of conversion for each individual, and The expected spend or value each user might generate.By combining these two models, we could calculate an expected customer value—or in some contexts, a proxy for customer lifetime value—for each user. These values were then used to inform bidding strategies. Instead of flat bids, we weighted our spend to prioritize higher-value users. The idea is that not all conversions are equal—some customers bring more revenue than others. So we designed a value-based targeting model that allocates budget more efficiently, based on predicted customer value. To validate this, we ran an A/B test. We created two groups that were as demographically and behaviorally similar as possible: One group was targeted equally, with uniform bidding. The other group was targeted based on expected value, using our model-driven bidding strategy. After running the experiment for about three weeks, we collected enough data and observed a 10% increase in conversions in the model-treated group, while actually lowering cost per conversion. Since then, we’ve run similar experiments for different clients, and results have been consistently promising. We’re continuing to explore platform capabilities—some DSPs like The Trade Desk allow us to pass user-level predicted values or weights, which gives us flexibility to implement these strategies at scale, depending on the platform’s support. 12.0.1.5 No holdout group? So it sounds like most of your work focuses on pre-campaign optimization, which is great. But as you know, measurement usually happens post-campaign. What if there’s no clean experimental design, like a holdout group? Maybe something went wrong, or the campaign wasn’t set up with measurement in mind. In those cases, how would you approach drawing causal inference from the campaign data? What methodology would you use? Response 1 That’s a great question—and definitely a challenge we face in real-world scenarios where clean holdout designs aren’t always feasible. When a true A/B test or randomized holdout group isn’t available, I typically rely on quasi-experimental methods to estimate causal effects. One common approach I use is propensity score matching or weighting, where we attempt to simulate a control group by matching treated individuals to similar untreated ones based on observable covariates—such as demographics, past behavior, or media exposure history. If time-series data is available, I might also apply difference-in-differences (DiD)—comparing outcomes for treated and control groups over time, before and after the campaign. This helps control for time-varying confounders that affect both groups similarly. In some cases, if there’s variation in exposure intensity (e.g., some users saw more ads than others), I’ve also used instrumental variable techniques or regression-based uplift models, especially when trying to isolate incremental effects across different dosage levels. The key in these situations is to understand the limitations of observational data, carefully account for selection bias, and validate assumptions through sensitivity analyses or placebo tests. So while it’s not as clean as a randomized experiment, with the right design and controls, we can still get reasonably robust causal estimates—even in messy, real-world data. My Response Yes, that’s a common situation—often we can’t set up a proper holdout group for every campaign due to cost or timing constraints. In those cases, we rely on quasi-experimental methods, but we do have to make some assumptions. One common approach I use is propensity score matching. The idea is to match users who were exposed to the campaign (the treatment group) with similar users who were not exposed during the campaign period (the control group). Matching is done based on observed characteristics such as demographics and pre-campaign behaviors. The assumption here is conditional independence—that once we’ve accounted for these covariates, exposure is as good as random. So, we estimate propensity scores (the probability of being treated) and then match treated and control users based on these scores. I’ve worked with propensity score models before. While my current role at Horizon Media focuses mostly on pre-campaign analytics, I do have a background in causal inference. I completed a postdoctoral research position at the University of Kansas, where I applied various quasi-experimental methods—including propensity score matching and difference-in-differences. In fact, I’ve used both methods in combination: first, matching treated and control groups based on their covariates, and then applying difference-in-differences to compare outcomes before and after the campaign. This layered approach helps to account for time trends and improves the robustness of the causal inference. So, even in the absence of a randomized design, I try to approximate causal effects using these principled statistical techniques. 12.0.1.6 You also mentioned that you’ve done some media exposure analysis. Could you tell me a bit more about what that involves? Certainly. Media exposure analysis is primarily descriptive rather than causal. The goal is to understand how different audience segments perform by comparing those who were exposed to a campaign or media touchpoint against those who were not exposed during a given time period. We look at metrics such as engagement, conversions, or other KPIs within these segments to get insights on relative performance. While this analysis helps identify patterns or associations, it does not by itself establish causality. 12.0.1.7 Balancing weights? You also mentioned something about a panel study. When you’re assembling weights for a sample, are you using those weights to estimate reach numbers? Or what exactly is the purpose of those weights in that context? That’s a great question. While this isn’t directly tied to measurement yet, it’s part of our marketing insights work—especially in the early stages of campaign planning or when preparing for a new business pitch. The idea is that we often work with very large population datasets—sometimes upwards of 250 million records. These datasets are intended to represent the U.S. adult population, but in practice, the distribution across demographics like age, income, or geography can be skewed. For example, when we compare our segment distributions to census benchmarks, we might find that certain groups—like 18 to 24-year-olds—are underrepresented. To correct for this, we apply demographic balancing weights. These weights assign higher importance to underrepresented groups so that when we analyze the data, it better reflects the true population distribution. So while the weights aren’t being used to estimate media reach directly, they’re essential for ensuring that the insights we generate from segment-level analysis are representative and not biased due to sampling imbalance. 🧠 Optional Add-On (If Asked Further) In other use cases—especially in measurement—similar weighting strategies could be applied to estimate reach or impact across a representative population, but in this specific case, it’s focused more on audience profiling and strategic planning. Additional Let’s say I’m working with a large national dataset, but we notice it’s underrepresenting younger adults—specifically the 18–24 age group, which only makes up about one-third of what we would expect based on census data. At the same time, older adults are overrepresented, appearing at twice their actual proportion in the U.S. population. Now, let’s say I build a segment of chocolate buyers, and I want to analyze their demographic breakdown and behaviors—for example, to understand how likely they are to use social media. If I look at this unweighted data, the results would be biased because the sample skews older. It might look like chocolate buyers are less active on social media—not because they actually are, but because younger consumers are under-captured in the dataset. To correct for that, I apply balancing weights. These weights increase the influence of underrepresented groups—like the 18–24-year-olds—and downweight the overrepresented groups, such as those over 65. This allows me to produce insights that are more reflective of the true national population, which is critical when delivering marketing recommendations or building go-to-market strategies. So in this case, the weighting isn’t used to estimate campaign reach, but rather to ensure the accuracy and representativeness of audience insights—which often informs pre-campaign targeting or even creative strategy. 12.0.1.8 And while working on all these research projects, what programming languages or tools do you typically use? Sure. For tasks like random sampling or creating balancing weights, I primarily use SQL, since most of our data lives in a Snowflake environment. I use SQL extensively for pulling data, doing exploratory analysis, and preparing data for further modeling. When it comes to predictive modeling on large datasets, especially in Databricks, I rely on PySpark to efficiently process and model data at scale. And whenever needed—for tasks like model development, feature engineering, or building custom scripts—I use Python, which is my go-to for most data science workflows. 12.0.1.9 Have you used any PySpark machine learning packages? Yes, I’ve used PySpark MLlib for predictive modeling tasks—such as lookalike modeling and churn prediction. Typically, I start by using SQL within PySpark to pull and filter data, since it’s often embedded directly into our PySpark workflows—especially when working in Databricks or connected to Snowflake. Once the data is pulled, I handle data cleaning and transformation using PySpark’s DataFrame API—this includes feature engineering and preparation for the modeling phase. For modeling, I use PySpark’s MLlib, including pipelines with transformers and estimators. These workflows often include stages like tokenization, normalization, and one-hot encoding, followed by models like logistic regression, random forest, or GBT. After training, I generate predictions or probabilities and write the results—such as propensity scores or likelihood estimates—back to Snowflake for downstream use in dashboards or activation. So, end-to-end, most of my modeling workflows in large-scale environments are done in PySpark. 💡 Bonus Tip (for Follow-up) If they ask you to name specific PySpark ML features, you can say: “I’ve used StringIndexer, VectorAssembler, Pipeline, and CrossValidator, and trained models like LogisticRegression and GBTClassifier using MLlib.” 12.0.1.10 Python usage level? You mentioned that you’ve been using Python. Can you tell me a bit more about the level of your experience? For example, some people just use Python for basic data manipulation in notebooks—like with pandas—while others go deeper and build reusable functions, classes, or even package their own modules. Have you ever built a full reusable Python class or packaged your methodology? That’s a great question. To be transparent—I haven’t yet built or published my own reusable Python package or class structure from scratch in a production environment. Before transitioning into industry, I was actually more experienced in R, where I had created my own internal libraries during my academic work. Since moving into industry, I’ve been using Python more extensively—mainly for data science workflows, including exploratory analysis, model development, and custom scripting within Jupyter notebooks or Databricks notebooks. While I haven’t formally packaged a full methodology into a Python module or class yet, I have written reusable functions, applied modular coding practices, and worked within structured notebooks that feed into larger workflows—especially in collaboration with engineering teams who handle deployment. I’d definitely be comfortable taking the next step into object-oriented or more production-level packaging if the project required it. I’m already writing clean, reusable code and following best practices like using virtual environments, Git for version control, and testing components before deployment. new hire will use 60-70% of the time, write production ready code That’s a fair point. I wouldn’t describe myself as a full-time programmer, but I’m very comfortable using programming languages—especially Python, PySpark, and SQL—to support my work in statistics, machine learning, and causal inference. My strength really lies in building robust models, such as classification models or gradient-boosted trees (e.g., XGBoost, LightGBM, or Spark’s GBT), and I can implement these reliably within the required coding frameworks. So while I might not be writing production-level software daily, I can confidently code, adapt, and scale solutions using the right tools for the problem—and I’m always improving on the engineering side. You’re absolutely right—object-oriented programming, especially understanding classes and class inheritance, is important for production-ready code. To be transparent, I haven’t yet had a need to build Python classes from scratch in my previous roles, as most of my work has been in functional or notebook-based workflows—often using R, which is not inherently object-oriented. That said, I do understand the concepts of encapsulation, methods, and class structure, and I’ve read and worked with codebases that follow OOP principles. While I haven’t authored a full class-based system yet, I’m confident that I can pick it up quickly—I’m a fast learner and I’m actively building more structure into my Python workflows. I see this as a great opportunity to grow on the engineering side, especially in an environment like yours where clean, modular, and deployable code is core to the product. 12.0.1.11 Are you familiar with Python decorators—like what’s a static method and what’s a class method? To be honest, I haven’t worked in depth with Python decorators, static methods, or class methods yet, so I wouldn’t claim deep expertise there. That said, I understand that decorators are a way to modify the behavior of functions or methods without changing their code, and that @staticmethod and @classmethod are used to define methods that don’t rely on instance-level data. I’ve come across them in code reviews and tutorials, but I haven’t had the opportunity to implement them myself. This is an area I’m actively looking to deepen, especially since I know it’s important in writing clean, modular, and reusable code in production environments. I’m confident I can ramp up quickly—I’m comfortable with learning new Python paradigms and have done so before when adapting from R to Python. 12.0.1.12 Do you know the difference between a shallow copy and a deep copy in Python? Sometimes this comes up when you’re working with mutable objects and you see unexpected behavior or warnings. Yes, I do. A shallow copy creates a new object, but it still references the same inner objects as the original. So if those inner objects are mutable and you change them in the copy, the changes will also appear in the original. A deep copy, on the other hand, creates a completely independent clone—not just of the outer object, but of all the nested objects inside it as well. So any changes to the deep copy won’t affect the original object at all. I remember encountering this when working with nested dictionaries and lists—it helped me understand how object references work in memory. 12.0.1.13 What’s the difference between positional arguments and keyword arguments in Python? Yes, I’ve definitely worked with both positional and keyword arguments when creating user-defined functions—especially while maintaining large automated demographic profile reports. To clarify: Positional arguments are the required parameters you pass to a function in a specific order. The function expects these arguments in the sequence they’re defined. Keyword arguments are optional parameters that have default values defined in the function signature. When calling the function, you can specify these arguments by name, and if you don’t provide a value, the default is used. I’m familiar with these concepts, though I admit I sometimes need to refresh details about how Python handles them internally—especially when dealing with *args and **kwargs to accept variable numbers of positional or keyword arguments. 12.0.1.14 Have you worked with Git and Git repositories? Do you have experience collaborating through Git? Yes, I’ve used Git through the terminal, though not on a daily basis. I have experience with basic Git commands like clone, add, commit, push, pull, and resolving simple merge conflicts. In most of my recent work, especially when collaborating less frequently, I’ve also used GitHub Desktop for convenience. While I haven’t worked extensively with branching strategies or in a heavily collaborative Git environment, I’m familiar with the core concepts and workflows. I’m confident I can easily adapt to more advanced or team-based Git practices, especially since I’m already comfortable using the terminal and have a solid understanding of version control principles. 12.0.1.15 Have you ever dealt with merge conflicts when working with Git? Yes, I’ve experienced merge conflicts—mostly in individual projects rather than team settings. They usually happen when I’ve created a feature branch and made changes, but the main branch has been updated in the meantime. If I try to merge without pulling and integrating those updates first, Git detects conflicting changes—especially if the same lines were modified in both branches—and that’s when a merge conflict occurs. To resolve it, I typically: Run git pull origin main into my branch to bring in the latest changes. Manually review the files where conflicts occurred—Git marks the conflicting sections, so I decide which changes to keep. After resolving conflicts, I use git add, then git commit to finalize the merge. Although I don’t face merge conflicts daily—because most of my recent work hasn’t involved active team collaboration—I’m familiar with the process and comfortable resolving them when they arise. I also try to work in isolated feature branches and regularly sync with the main branch to minimize conflicts. And I’m always open to learning more advanced Git workflows used in engineering-heavy environments. 12.0.1.16 Do you know the difference between WHERE and HAVING in SQL? Yes—WHERE and HAVING are both used to filter data, but they’re applied at different stages of SQL query execution. WHERE is used to filter rows before any grouping or aggregation happens. You typically use it to filter raw records based on column conditions. HAVING is used after a GROUP BY clause—when you want to filter aggregated results. So, if you grouped your data and calculated something like SUM or COUNT, you’d use HAVING to filter those group-level results. This difference is tied to the order of execution in SQL: WHERE comes early, while HAVING comes later, after aggregation. 12.0.1.17 What’s the difference between UNION and UNION ALL in SQL? Yes, the main difference is how duplicates are handled when combining result sets. UNION merges two or more datasets but removes duplicate rows in the final output. UNION ALL combines all rows from the datasets including duplicates, so it’s usually faster because it skips the deduplication step. So if you want all records including duplicates, you use UNION ALL. If you want a distinct combined set, you use UNION. 12.0.1.18 What are some ways to handle row duplication in a PySpark DataFrame? They want to know if you can explain how to detect and remove duplicate rows using PySpark. Yes, handling duplicate rows is a common task in PySpark DataFrames. PySpark provides a couple of ways to deal with duplicates: You can use the dropDuplicates() method, which removes duplicate rows based on all columns or a subset of columns if you specify them. Another way is to use the distinct() method, which returns a new DataFrame with only unique rows across all columns. df_no_duplicates = df.dropDuplicates() df_no_duplicates = df.dropDuplicates([&#39;column1&#39;, &#39;column2&#39;]) Because PySpark is a distributed framework, these operations are optimized to run efficiently on large datasets spread across multiple nodes. While I might not recall every function name or parameter by heart, I’m comfortable exploring documentation or writing such code as needed in real projects. 12.0.1.19 Have you created your own UDF (User Defined Function) in Spark? Yes, I have created UDFs a few times, especially after estimating probabilities or when I needed to apply some custom logic that wasn’t available in the built-in Spark functions. While I don’t create UDFs regularly, I understand their purpose—they allow you to extend Spark’s functionality by defining custom operations that can run across distributed data. Over time, as I learned more about PySpark, I’ve relied more on existing libraries and built-in functions, which are generally more efficient. But when needed, I’m comfortable writing my own UDFs to handle specific cases. # The &quot;probability&quot; column contains a vector of probabilities for each class. # To get the probability of the positive class, you can extract the second element of the vector. from pyspark.sql.functions import udf from pyspark.sql.types import DoubleType # UDF to extract positive class probability (index 1) get_pos_prob = udf(lambda v: float(v[1]), DoubleType()) predictions = predictions.withColumn(&quot;pos_probability&quot;, get_pos_prob(&quot;probability&quot;)) predictions.select(&quot;pos_probability&quot;).show() 12.0.1.20 Between PySpark’s built-in functions and User Defined Functions (UDFs), which do you think is more optimized in terms of performance? Generally, PySpark’s built-in functions tend to offer better performance compared to UDFs. This is because built-in functions are native to the Spark engine, allowing Spark to optimize their execution across the cluster efficiently. UDFs, on the other hand, often require serialization and run outside the Catalyst optimizer, which can slow down processing. While sometimes you might need to write a UDF for custom logic not supported by built-in functions, whenever possible, leveraging PySpark’s native functions will generally be faster and more scalable. Finding the right balance between clarity, maintainability, and performance is key. I’m always looking for the most efficient approach depending on the problem and the platform. 12.0.1.21 Are you familiar with the data skew issue in Spark? Do you know what causes it and common ways to fix it? Yes, I’m familiar with the concept of data skew in distributed systems like Spark. Data skew happens when the data is unevenly distributed across partitions—meaning one or a few partitions have a disproportionately large amount of data compared to others. This causes those tasks to become bottlenecks, slowing down the entire job. While I haven’t had to deeply troubleshoot severe skew issues in my projects yet, I understand some common solutions, such as: Salting the keys before joins or aggregations to distribute skewed keys more evenly across partitions. Using broadcast joins when one dataset is small enough, which avoids shuffling large skewed data. Increasing the number of partitions or repartitioning the data based on a more balanced key. I’m eager to gain more hands-on experience in detecting and fixing data skew because I recognize its importance for optimizing performance in large-scale data processing. 12.0.1.22 Can you tell me the differences between L1 and L2 regularization in regression? Yes, both L1 and L2 regularization are techniques used to reduce overfitting by adding a penalty to the model’s coefficients. L1 regularization (Lasso) adds the sum of the absolute values of the coefficients as a penalty. This tends to shrink some coefficients exactly to zero, effectively performing feature selection by eliminating less important features. L2 regularization (Ridge) adds the sum of the squared values of the coefficients as a penalty. It shrinks coefficients towards zero but does not set them exactly to zero, so all features remain in the model but with smaller magnitudes. In summary: L1 encourages sparsity (more zeros), L2 encourages small but non-zero coefficients, both helping prevent overfitting but in slightly different ways. 12.0.1.23 How can you tell if a model is overfitting or underfitting? And if a model is underfitting, what are some common solutions you’d suggest? Overfitting happens when a model learns the training data too well, including noise and small fluctuations. As a result, it doesn’t generalize well to unseen or test data. It typically occurs when the model is too complex relative to the amount of data. On the other hand, underfitting is when the model is too simple to capture the underlying patterns in the data. It performs poorly on both the training and test datasets, indicating that it hasn’t learned enough. You can identify overfitting when the training accuracy is high but the test accuracy is much lower — this gap between training and test performance is a clear sign. To address overfitting, you can: Reduce model complexity (e.g., use fewer features or simpler models), Apply regularization (like L1 or L2), Use cross-validation to ensure generalization. To address underfitting, you can: Increase model complexity (e.g., deeper trees, more features), Use more relevant features or interactions, Provide more training data if available. The goal is to find the right balance where your model performs well on both training and test sets. 12.0.2 Second Round Interviewer: Sr. Data Scientist Guongen Scenario: E-commerce client is running an experiment on the checkout page to assess whether a cosmetic change leads to meaningful business improvements (e.g., higher conversions, better customer experience). The goal is to design a science-based approach that can quantify and validate the causal impact of this change. This is about a e-commerce client, there is a website checkout page experiment. You are testing designing an system to assert the impact of cosmetic change. The goal is to determine whether, the changes should result in meaningful improvements. 12.0.2.1 Question 1: Design a science-based approach to assess the impact of a cosmetic change to an e-commerce website’s checkout page. Determine whether the change is meaningful for the company. Step-by-Step Science-Based Approach Clarify the Goal Assess whether the cosmetic change improves business performance. Define what is “meaningful” → Usually conversion rate, revenue per visitor, or drop-off reduction. Define Primary &amp; Secondary Metrics Primary metric: Conversion rate (e.g., completed checkout / checkout page views) Secondary metrics: Bounce rate, session duration, drop-off at each checkout step, revenue per user, etc. Experimental Design (A/B Test) Randomized Controlled Trial: Control group: Sees original checkout page Treatment group: Sees cosmetically updated page Randomize at the user or session level to remove bias. Ensure no contamination between groups (e.g., same user doesn’t see both versions). Set Hypotheses Null hypothesis (H₀): No difference in conversion rate between control and treatment. Alternative hypothesis (H₁): The treatment improves conversion rate (or other metrics). Determine Sample Size &amp; Duration Use power analysis to calculate the required sample size based on: Baseline conversion rate Minimum detectable effect (MDE) Desired significance level (α = 0.05) Power (usually 80%) Ensure Data Quality Log page version, user ID, timestamps, outcomes Validate that users are correctly assigned and not switching groups Monitor real-time stats for randomization balance Analyze Results Use a two-proportion z-test for conversion rates Or a t-test if comparing revenue per user Check: Statistical significance (p-value &lt; 0.05?) Practical significance (Is the lift large enough to matter?) Optionally apply Bayesian inference for real-time insights Interpret Results If the change yields a statistically and practically significant lift, consider rolling it out. If not significant, weigh the cost/benefit of keeping the change for aesthetic purposes. Plan for Rollout Use a phased rollout or canary deployment to monitor post-launch impact Watch for long-term effects and regression to the mean What If You Can’t Run an A/B Test? If randomization is not possible: Use observational causal inference methods: Propensity Score Matching Difference-in-Differences (if pre-post data is available) Interrupted Time Series 12.0.2.2 5. Determine Sample Size &amp; Duration (Power Analysis) To ensure the experiment has enough statistical power to detect meaningful changes: ✅ Define Key Inputs Baseline Conversion Rate (p₁): Estimate from historical data (e.g., 5% conversion rate). Minimum Detectable Effect (MDE): Smallest relative lift worth detecting (e.g., 0.5% absolute increase). Significance Level (α): Probability of Type I error (commonly set at 0.05). Statistical Power (1 - β): Probability of detecting a true effect (commonly set at 0.8 or 0.9). 📊 Calculate Sample Size Use standard formulas or a power calculator (e.g., statsmodels, G*Power, or online tools): Make sure the sample size is per variant (control/treatment). Double it for total required observations. 🕒 Estimate Experiment Duration Divide required sample size by expected daily traffic to checkout. Adjust for: Seasonal effects Potential outliers or anomalies Business constraints (e.g., promo campaigns, product launches) Example: If baseline CR is 5% and you want to detect a 10% relative lift (5.5%), then the MDE is 0.5%. You might need ~25,000 users per group. 12.0.2.3 7. Analyze Results After the test has run for a sufficient period: ✅ Preliminary Checks Randomization balance: Confirm demographics or behaviors are evenly split. Data sanity: Are there drops in tracking? Unusual traffic spikes? 📊 Statistical Testing Use appropriate statistical tests to compare control vs. treatment. 12.0.2.3.1 (a) Binary Metrics (e.g., Conversion Rate) Use a two-proportion z-test: \\[ z = \\frac{p_1 - p_2}{\\sqrt{p(1 - p)(\\frac{1}{n_1} + \\frac{1}{n_2})}} \\] Where: \\(p_1, p_2\\) are observed conversion rates, \\(p\\) is pooled rate, \\(n_1, n_2\\) are sample sizes. 12.0.2.3.2 (b) Continuous Metrics (e.g., revenue/user) Use a t-test for mean comparison. Check for normality and variance assumptions (or use non-parametric tests if needed). 12.0.2.3.3 (c) Multiple Metrics or Tests Apply corrections like Bonferroni or Benjamini-Hochberg to control false discovery. ✅ Interpret Results Statistical Significance: p-value &lt; 0.05 (or confidence interval excludes 0) Practical Significance: Is the lift material for the business? E.g., A 0.2% lift on a $1M daily revenue = $2,000/day Confidence Intervals: Report the range of plausible values for the lift. 12.0.2.4 If they are looking for a single metrics, what will you suggest? A: I would suggest using the “checkout drop-off rate” as the key metric. 12.0.2.4.1 ✅ Why Drop-off Rate? Since the experiment is about a cosmetic change on the checkout page, the most direct behavioral signal is whether users proceed through the funnel or abandon it. Drop-off rate is defined as: \\[ \\text{Drop-off Rate} = 1 - \\frac{\\text{Number of completed checkouts}}{\\text{Number of users who reached the checkout page}} \\] This metric isolates the effect of the change on the checkout step itself, rather than being influenced by upstream events like product browsing or add-to-cart. 12.0.2.4.2 ✅ Advantages: Sensitive to UI/UX changes on that page. Simple to interpret — a decrease in drop-off rate signals improvement. Allows for quick testing and prioritization of UI changes. 12.0.2.4.3 🚀 Alternative Single-Metric Suggestions (optional to mention): If asked for other candidates or to justify: Conversion Rate: Good holistic metric, but may be affected by factors outside the checkout page. Time to Checkout: Measures efficiency but doesn’t capture abandonment behavior. Revenue per Session/User: High-level impact, but harder to attribute to cosmetic changes alone. 12.0.2.5 Second question: How would you design the A/B testing? What are the steps involved? Here’s a clean and structured way to document and improve your response to the second interview question from LiveRamp: 1. Define the Objective Clearly state the goal of the test: to assess whether the cosmetic change to the checkout page improves user behavior or business outcomes (e.g., reduces drop-off rate or increases conversions). 2. Identify Key Metric(s) Primary metric: Drop-off rate at the checkout stage (as discussed). Secondary metrics: Conversion rate, time on page, cart abandonment rate, bounce rate, etc. 3. Formulate Hypothesis Example: “We hypothesize that the new checkout design will reduce the drop-off rate by at least X%, leading to improved conversion.” 4. Determine Test Design Randomized controlled experiment: Randomly assign users into: Control group (A): sees the original checkout design. Treatment group (B): sees the new cosmetic design. Randomization unit: Typically user-level, to avoid spillover. Ensure equal distribution across segments (e.g., by traffic source, device type). 5. Calculate Sample Size &amp; Test Duration Use power analysis to determine required sample size: Inputs: baseline conversion/drop-off rate, minimum detectable effect (MDE), significance level (α, usually 0.05), and power (typically 80%). Determine test duration based on traffic flow to reach the required sample size. 6. Implement &amp; Monitor Roll out the A/B test using an experimentation platform (e.g., Optimizely, LaunchDarkly, internal tools). Monitor in real-time for: Data collection issues Unusual traffic patterns Early indicators (but avoid peeking bias) 7. Analyze Results Conduct statistical analysis: Compare drop-off rates (or other metrics) between groups using hypothesis testing (e.g., t-test, z-test). Check confidence intervals and p-values. Assess practical significance in addition to statistical significance. 8. Interpret and Recommend If the new design significantly outperforms the old one: Roll it out more broadly. If not: Consider iterating on the design or testing further hypotheses. 💬 Optional (Advanced): Handling Imperfections You can mention if you’re asked: Use stratified randomization or covariate balancing to improve test validity. Address potential non-compliance or exposure leakage (e.g., users seeing both versions). Consider Bayesian methods or sequential testing as alternatives to fixed-horizon A/B tests. 12.0.2.6 What is the purpose of randomization? Randomization ensures that the treatment and control groups are statistically equivalent on both observed and unobserved variables at the start of the experiment. This allows us to: Eliminate selection bias: Without randomization, differences in outcomes might be due to pre-existing differences between groups. Ensure comparability: Any post-experiment difference in outcome can be attributed to the treatment itself, assuming all else is equal. Enable causal inference: Randomization justifies treating the difference in outcomes between groups as the causal effect of the treatment (assuming proper execution). Balance confounders: Both known and unknown confounding variables are, on average, evenly distributed across groups. 🔍 Example (if you want to elaborate): For instance, in a checkout page A/B test, if we didn’t randomize users, and one group ends up with more returning customers while the other has mostly new users, the outcome might be driven by user type, not the UI change. Randomization avoids this problem. 12.0.2.7 During A/B testing, how do you remove the effect of confounding factors? Primary approach: ✅ Randomization is the main defense. It ensures that both known and unknown confounders are balanced across treatment and control groups on average. This reduces systematic differences and makes the groups comparable. But in practice: 📌 Stratified randomization may be used when you know certain confounders (e.g., device type, geography) are critical — this ensures balance within those subgroups. 📊 Post-stratification or covariate adjustment: In analysis, you can use regression models to control for observed variables that might still differ slightly after randomization (especially with smaller samples). 🧪 A/A testing before the A/B test can also help check for baseline imbalance, ensuring randomization worked correctly. A/A testing is an experiment where both the control and treatment groups receive the same experience — meaning no actual change is being tested. It’s often used before running an A/B test. Purpose of A/A Testing Check Randomization Make sure the random assignment process splits users into comparable groups. Validate Experiment Setup Ensure the tracking, metric logging, and statistical analysis are working correctly. Estimate Natural Variance / Noise Understand the baseline variability in key metrics when no treatment effect exists. You want to test a new checkout flow, but before running A/B: Run an A/A test where both groups get the current flow. If your system reports a statistically significant difference, it’s a red flag — you might have: Instrumentation errors Biased sample splits Misconfigured metrics Clean Answer for Interview: “Randomization is our first line of defense — it balances both observed and unobserved confounders across groups. But if we’re concerned about imbalance in known variables, we can use stratified randomization or include covariates in a regression model to control for residual confounding during analysis.” 12.0.2.8 What if the control group is much smaller than the treated group in a propensity score matching setting? When the control group is much smaller than the treated group, finding good matches for all treated units becomes challenging, which can reduce the quality of the matching and the validity of causal estimates. Here are common approaches to handle this imbalance: Use matching with replacement: This allows control units to be matched to multiple treated units, improving match quality but increasing dependence on fewer controls. Caliper matching or nearest neighbor matching: Set a maximum allowable distance in propensity scores (caliper) to avoid poor matches; unmatched treated units may be discarded, improving validity but reducing sample size. Weighting methods (e.g., inverse probability of treatment weighting - IPTW): Instead of matching, use weights based on propensity scores to balance groups, which can be more efficient when control samples are limited. Consider alternative causal inference methods: Such as regression adjustment, stratification, or doubly robust estimators, which can better utilize all data even with imbalanced groups. Ultimately, when the control group is small, some treated units may remain unmatched or poorly matched, and it’s important to report this limitation transparently and consider sensitivity analyses. 12.0.2.9 Regression Adjustment (Covariate Adjustment) You use a regression model (like linear regression, logistic regression, etc.) to model the outcome as a function of the treatment indicator and other covariates (confounders). By including covariates in the model, you control for their effects, effectively adjusting for confounding. This helps estimate the treatment effect while holding other factors constant. 12.0.2.9.1 How it relates to propensity score methods Both methods aim to adjust for confounding by balancing covariates between treated and control groups. Regression adjustment models the outcome directly, while propensity score methods focus on balancing covariates first. Sometimes, both are combined in a doubly robust approach for more robust causal estimates. 12.0.2.10 Q: We did A/B testing and found a statistically significant result (low p-value). What’s the next step? Would you suggest launching the feature? Answer: A statistically significant p-value indicates there’s evidence the treatment effect is unlikely due to random chance. However, statistical significance alone is not sufficient to decide to launch. The next steps should include: Assess Practical Significance: Check if the effect size is meaningful from a business perspective. A tiny lift with a low p-value might not justify the cost or risk of launching. Check for Robustness: Validate the result by looking for consistency across segments, time periods, or secondary metrics. Look for any unexpected negative impacts. Analyze Potential Risks: Consider possible negative side effects on user experience, system performance, or downstream KPIs. Consider Sample Size &amp; Power: Confirm that the sample size was sufficient and the test was run long enough to avoid false positives. Run Additional Tests if Needed: If unsure, run a follow-up experiment or an extended test. Business Alignment: Align with product, marketing, and stakeholder teams to evaluate if the change fits strategic priorities. Only after these steps and cross-functional agreement, you should consider launching the feature. 12.0.2.11 Would you consider the novelty effect?** Answer: Yes, the novelty effect is important to consider in A/B testing. It refers to the temporary boost in user engagement or behavior simply because something is new or different, not necessarily because the change is truly better. To account for this, I would: Analyze longer-term data: Run the experiment for a sufficient duration to see if the effect sustains over time beyond the initial excitement phase. Monitor post-launch metrics: Continue monitoring after launch to detect if the effect diminishes as users get used to the change. Segment analysis: Look at new vs. returning users to see if novelty impacts these groups differently. Repeat tests if needed: Consider rerunning or running phased rollouts to validate the persistence of the effect. In summary, while a significant lift is promising, ensuring the impact is not just a temporary novelty effect is crucial for confident decision-making. 12.0.2.12 How do you decide the sample size for an A/B test?** Answer: Deciding the sample size depends on several factors to ensure the test has enough power to detect meaningful effects: Minimum Detectable Effect (MDE): The smallest effect size you care about detecting (e.g., a 2% lift in conversion). Smaller MDEs require larger samples. Statistical Significance Level (α): Typically set at 0.05, this controls the false positive rate. Statistical Power (1-β): Usually set at 80% or 90%, this is the probability of detecting the effect if it truly exists. Baseline Conversion Rate: The existing rate helps estimate variance. Test Duration and Traffic: How much traffic you can allocate and for how long affects feasibility. Using these parameters, you can calculate the required sample size per group using formulas or tools like statistical calculators or libraries (e.g., statsmodels in Python). 12.0.2.13 The main metrics closely related to sample size in experiment design are: Statistical Power The probability of correctly rejecting the null hypothesis (detecting a true effect). Larger sample sizes increase power. Significance Level (Alpha) The threshold for Type I error (false positive rate), usually set at 0.05. Lower alpha requires larger sample size. Effect Size The minimum detectable difference or change you want to observe. Smaller effect sizes require larger samples to detect. Variance (or Standard Deviation) of the Metric More variability in the data means you need a larger sample to detect effects. Confidence Interval Width Smaller sample sizes lead to wider confidence intervals (less precise estimates). In summary: Sample size depends on the desired power, significance level, effect size you want to detect, and variability of the outcome metric. 12.0.2.14 Q: If a change has already been launched to part of the users without an A/B test, how do you evaluate the impact of the change?** Observational impact analysis When an experiment wasn’t set up beforehand, we can use observational causal inference methods to estimate the impact. Some approaches include: Difference-in-Differences (DiD): Compare the metric changes over time between the treated group (users who saw the change) and a comparable control group (users who didn’t), assuming parallel trends before the change. Propensity Score Matching (PSM): Match treated users with similar untreated users based on observed covariates to reduce confounding and mimic randomization. Regression Adjustment / Covariate Adjustment: Use regression models controlling for user characteristics and time trends to estimate the effect of the change. Synthetic Control Methods: Construct a weighted combination of control units to create a synthetic control group that closely matches the treated group before the intervention. Instrumental Variables (if available): Use external variables that affect treatment assignment but not the outcome directly to isolate causal impact. These approaches rely on assumptions like no unobserved confounding and consistent data, so it’s important to validate these assumptions where possible. Great — this is a realistic scenario and a very common question in interviews when experimentation wasn’t done properly. Here’s how you can structure your cleaned-up and more polished response for your prep notebook: 12.0.2.15 There was a change in the website, but no control group was set up. Can you evaluate the impact of the change? (Follow-up: Can you test if there’s a significant change using time series?) 1. Clarify the Timeline Ask: When exactly did the change go live? Identify a pre-change and post-change period. 2. Use Time Series Analysis If you have access to historical data before and after the change, you can do: Interrupted Time Series (ITS) Analysis A quasi-experimental method. Models the trend before the intervention (change) and tests whether: There’s an immediate level change at the intervention point. The slope or trend changes after the intervention. “This helps assess both short- and long-term impact.” Statistical Significance in Time Series To test for significance: Fit a regression model like: metric ~ time + intervention_flag + time_after_intervention where intervention_flag = 1 after the change, and 0 before. Test if the coefficient for intervention_flag is statistically significant (i.e., the change caused a shift). Use confidence intervals, p-values, or bootstrapping to validate results. Alternative: Causal Impact (Bayesian Structural Time Series) Developed by Google. Compares observed post-intervention data to a counterfactual generated from the pre-period. Can also handle seasonality and auto-correlation. 🧠 Bonus (if asked): If data is very noisy, use moving averages or smoothing. If other external changes happened, call out confounding factors. If you have access to similar users/sites where the change wasn’t rolled out, use them as synthetic control. 🔑 Key Point: Even without a control group, time series methods like ITS or Causal Impact can help estimate causal effects, though results are more assumption-dependent than true A/B testing. 12.0.2.16 Comparing pre- and post-treatment time periods using a single difference model is a valid and simple starting point for measuring impact when no control group is available. ✅ Single Difference Model (Pre/Post Comparison) 🧮 Basic Setup: Assume you have a time series metric (e.g., conversion rate, average order value, bounce rate) measured daily or weekly. Let: \\(\\bar{Y}_{\\text{post}}\\): average of the metric after the website change \\(\\bar{Y}_{\\text{pre}}\\): average of the metric before the website change Then the single difference estimate is: \\[ \\Delta Y = \\bar{Y}_{\\text{post}} - \\bar{Y}_{\\text{pre}} \\] You can test whether this difference is statistically significant using a t-test if assumptions are met. ❗ Limitations of Single Difference Confounding factors: Other changes (e.g., seasonality, campaigns, promotions) may also affect the metric during the same period. Trend effects: If there is a natural upward or downward trend, simple pre-post difference can misattribute effects to the change. 🧠 Better: Interrupted Time Series (ITS) Instead of just comparing two averages, ITS fits a regression model over time, which accounts for the level and trend: \\[ Y_t = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\cdot \\text{time}_t + \\beta_2 \\cdot \\text{intervention}_t + \\beta_3 \\cdot \\text{time\\_after}_t + \\varepsilon_t \\] Where: \\(\\text{intervention}_t = 1\\) after change, 0 before \\(\\text{time\\_after}_t\\): time since the intervention Then: \\(\\beta_2\\): change in level (immediate effect) \\(\\beta_3\\): change in trend ✅ When is single difference okay? You may use single difference if: The metric is stable over time (no strong trend or seasonality) The time window is short, and no major other changes occurred You clearly observe a jump in the metric right after the intervention 🧪 Example in words: “We compared the average conversion rate in the 2 weeks before vs. 2 weeks after the change. The difference was 0.8%, which was statistically significant at the 5% level using a t-test. However, we acknowledge that this method does not control for trend or seasonality.” 12.0.2.17 ✅Paired (Matched) t-test — When to Use Use a paired t-test when: You’re measuring the same unit (e.g., users, sessions, products) before and after the change. You’re comparing within-unit change, not across different groups. Let’s say you tracked conversion rate per user before and after the checkout redesign for users who interacted with the site in both periods. This tests: \\[ H_0: \\mu_{\\text{post}} = \\mu_{\\text{pre}} \\quad \\text{vs} \\quad H_1: \\mu_{\\text{post}} \\neq \\mu_{\\text{pre}} \\] ✅ Benefits: Controls for user-level fixed effects (natural differences in behavior). More statistical power, since variation within users is usually smaller than across users. ❗ Notes: You need to match users correctly — only those who were active in both periods. Make sure your metric is meaningful per-user (e.g., average spend, conversion flag, time on site). 12.0.2.18 Compare linear models and tree-based models: Model Structure Aspect Linear Models Tree-Based Models Model Type Parametric (assumes a linear form) Non-parametric (learns splits from data) Functional Form Linear equation (e.g. y = βx + ε) Series of decision rules (splits) Interpretability High (easy to explain coefficients) Lower (complex decision paths, unless small trees) Data Assumptions Assumption Linear Models Tree-Based Models Linearity Assumes linear relationships Captures non-linear relationships naturally Feature Interactions Must be manually specified Captures interactions automatically Feature Scaling Sensitive to feature scale Not sensitive to scale Performance &amp; Flexibility Area Linear Models Tree-Based Models Handling Complexity Not great with high complexity Great for complex patterns and nonlinearity Overfitting Risk Lower (especially with regularization) Higher (especially with deep trees) Handling Outliers Sensitive to outliers More robust to outliers Use Cases Use Case Linear Models Tree-Based Models Fast, interpretable baselines Yes No (unless using shallow trees) High-dimensional sparse data Strong (e.g., with Lasso) Not ideal Tabular with complex interactions Weak Very strong (especially with ensembles like Random Forest, XGBoost) 🧠 Summary (What to Say in an Interview) “Linear models are simple, fast, and interpretable — best when relationships are roughly linear and you need explainability. Tree-based models are more powerful for capturing non-linear patterns, variable interactions, and are robust to outliers — especially when using ensembles like Random Forest or Gradient Boosting. However, they trade off some interpretability and may overfit if not tuned properly.” 12.0.2.19 Suppose that your model is taking too long to run. How would you optimize that performance? 1. Diagnose the Bottleneck “First, I’d profile the pipeline to identify where the slowdown is — whether it’s in data loading, preprocessing, training, or prediction. Tools like cProfile, line_profiler, or Spark/PySpark logs (if on big data) can help here.” 2. Optimize Data Handling Reduce Dataset Size: Sample a representative subset for model prototyping. Use stratified sampling if class imbalance matters. Efficient Data Structures: Use numpy arrays or pandas optimized types (category, float32). Avoid Duplicates / Irrelevant Features: Drop highly correlated or low-variance features to reduce computation. 3. Improve Model Training Efficiency Simplify the Model: Use a simpler algorithm if accuracy-speed tradeoff is acceptable. For tree-based models: reduce depth, number of trees, or sample rate. Use Regularization: Regularization can reduce overfitting and help convergence faster. Tune Hyperparameters Intelligently: Use RandomizedSearchCV instead of GridSearchCV. Use early stopping for boosted trees or neural nets. 4. Use Efficient Libraries or Hardware Libraries: Switch to faster implementations (e.g., lightgbm over xgboost, or scikit-learn over custom loops). Parallelization: Use multi-core training (n_jobs, joblib, Spark). Use GPU acceleration for deep learning models (e.g., PyTorch, TensorFlow with CUDA). Batch Processing: If using deep learning, batch your data for faster GPU utilization. 5. Persist and Cache Intelligently Save intermediate results: Avoid redundant computations in data pipelines. Use caching in Spark: df.cache() or persist() to reuse expensive transformations. 6. Model Format and Deployment Model Compression: Use quantization or pruning for deployment.

My first step is always to profile the workflow, then make targeted improvements — whether it’s simplifying the model, batching efficiently, or tuning smarter. I also leverage the right tools, whether it’s Spark, LightGBM, or GPU acceleration.” "],["experiences.html", "Chapter 13 Experiences 13.1 Amazon Sr.Economist 13.2 Amazon Economist II", " Chapter 13 Experiences 13.1 Amazon Sr.Economist In ab test, how do you communicate significance level change to non-technicals?

This is a preliminary, general interview for the Economist role at Amazon. Location details: Since we don’t know the specific team yet, the exact location is also undecided. That said, about 80% of our Economist positions are based in Seattle, Washington. Other common locations include Arlington, Virginia, and the Bay Area in California. 13.2.1.1 Are you open to those locations, or do you have preferences? I’m in Chicago right now and open to relocation. 13.2.1.2 Role types at Amazon: We hire Economists across three main skill sets: Reduced-form causal analysis: this is the skill set most commonly hired for and the one you’re interviewing for. Financial, macroeconomic, and forecasting analysis Structural or empirical industrial organization (IO) economics: This gives you a sense of the types of work Economists do at Amazon and where your role fits within the broader organization. 13.2.1.3 Technical Breadth We’re looking for a wide range of causal inference methods that you can bring to the table. Specifically, we’d like you to be familiar with at least two or three methods — for example, difference-in-differences, synthetic control, propensity score matching, or double machine learning. You don’t need to be an expert in all of them, but you should have experience applying multiple methods and understand, at a high level, what they are, how they’re applied, and the trade-offs between them. This is what we mean by technical breadth. 13.2.1.4 Technical Depth This is where you are expected to be an expert in one or two specific methods — your bread and butter approaches. You should understand the method thoroughly, including the trade-offs and downstream impacts of different decisions within it. During the interview, you’ll choose which method to go deep on. We’ll evaluate both breadth and depth through a business case study, which will be based on a real Amazon business scenario. There’s no single right or wrong answer — we want to see how you think through the problem, what methods you bring to the table, and how you apply one method in depth. 13.2.1.5 Case Study Flow –Technical Breadth– Step One – Clarify the Problem The interviewer will provide the case example. Your first step is to ask clarifying questions about both the problem and the business context. Understand the business drivers, motivations, and goals so you can see the bigger picture and know what the business is actually trying to achieve. Step One begins when the interviewer presents the business question. Your task is to ask clarifying questions to understand the business side of the problem. For example, you might ask: Do they have the data you need? Have they tried something similar in the past, and what were the outcomes? What are they hoping to achieve — what are their goals and expected gains? -By understanding the business context and objectives, you can work backwards to ensure your solution addresses the problem effectively and covers all key aspects. Step Two – Explore Multiple Methods Propose two to three potential methods to solve the problem. You don’t need to be an expert in all of them, but you should be able to discuss them at a high level, including their trade-offs, strengths, and limitations. Step Three – Narrow to One Method After discussing the options with the interviewer, you’ll narrow the choices down to a single method — your bread and butter method. This is the method you are most familiar with and know the best. Explain how you would apply it, what decisions matter within the method, and what potential outcomes to expect. –Technical Depth– Step Four – Apply the Method At this stage, you will go deep into your chosen method. Walk through how you would design, implement, and measure it. This is where we assess your technical depth — your ability to apply the method in practice. We’ll evaluate how you account for different variables, consider potential treatment effects, and handle nuances that could affect the outcome. This step demonstrates your mastery of the method and your ability to use it effectively to solve a real business problem. 13.2.1.6 Example Case Study Context &amp; Role Expectations For example, you might work on a content team — not necessarily the Amazon Books team — helping Amazon decide which products to show first on the Amazon.com site based on what a user is browsing and what products are available. This could serve as a sample case study question. As an Economist at Amazon, your role goes beyond technical skills. You need to: Follow business-related conversations, even when they aren’t technical. Translate non-technical business problems into scientific experiments. Translate technical requirements and results into non-technical language so you can communicate effectively with business stakeholders. This combination of technical and business fluency is key to success in the role. 13.2.2 Leadership Principle Portion Another part of the interview will focus on Amazon’s Leadership Principles. In your case, you will only be assessed on one principle — but I want you to prepare for three in particular: Earn Trust Ownership Deliver Results Additionally, be ready to share a story about a time you failed or didn’t meet a deliverable. This should include what happened, what you learned, and how you applied those lessons moving forward. The failure story ties into the Earn Trust principle — but that’s not the only way Earn Trust can be assessed. If Earn Trust is the principle your interviewer focuses on, the question might involve a failure-related scenario, but it could also take a different form. For example, they might ask how you influenced a group of people when you expected pushback, or how you built trust in a challenging situation. I’m asking you to prepare a failure-related story just in case the interviewer chooses that angle — but also be ready for other variations of Earn Trust questions. 13.2.2.1 Teams Currently Hiring at Amazon Right now, several different teams are hiring economists, including: Amazon Books Commerce Content Team – owns workflows tied to the Amazon.com retail site. Kindle Devices Team Project Kuiper Team Customer Behavior Analytics (CBA) Team – part of the Central Science organization, focused on understanding and predicting customer behavior. Returns &amp; Recommerce Team – manages all product returns flowing through sort centers and fulfillment centers, optimizing processes and demand planning. This one leans more toward finance/macro forecasting. The case study question you get in your interview may or may not relate to one of these domains — it’s not necessarily tied to a specific team. 13.2.2.2 Final Round Interview Process You will have one final round interview, no matter which teams you speak to. If you do not pass the final round, you will not be team-matched again. In the final round, you’ll interview with a specific hiring team for their role. Amazon hires “Amazon first, team second”: If you pass the final round but the fit with that team isn’t ideal, Amazon will find another team for you. You won’t need to redo the interview — they’ll simply repeat the team matching process until you’re placed. You’ll only go through the final round once. After your interview, Amazon will follow up within two business days with the outcome.

Sure. For a large retail furniture client, we were asked to build a churn model to predict which customers were unlikely to return for another purchase within 6 months. We began by defining churn using a rolling window approach, since furniture purchases are infrequent. We labeled customers as churned if they had no purchase activity within 180 days of their last transaction. I engineered features from both transactional history (like recency, frequency, and product category mix) and from media exposure data to understand marketing interactions. We also included demographics, payment type, and delivery speed. After comparing several models — including logistic regression, GBT, and XGBoost — XGBoost performed best, with an AUC of 0.82. To interpret results, I used SHAP values to identify key drivers like recency, transaction amount, and exposure to certain media channels. The final output was a score that fed into marketing’s CRM tool, allowing personalized winback campaigns. Over 3 months, the campaign based on our scores drove a 12% improvement in repeat rates vs. the control group. 14.2 How do you select features when you have 400+ binary variables? I’ve dealt with this exact situation — in one project, we had 400 binary features representing purchase behavior and segment tags. My process starts with domain understanding: grouping features into thematic categories like furniture type, room category, or lifestyle signal, to detect redundancy. Next, I check sparsity and variance filters — removing features with extremely low variance or near-zero frequency. I also calculate correlation matrices to detect highly collinear features. Then I use model-based importance — especially with tree models like XGBoost — to narrow down top features. SHAP values help validate which features contribute most across observations. Finally, I may apply dimensionality reduction (e.g., PCA) if needed, but prefer interpretable subsets unless performance truly demands it. This process gives me a good balance of performance, interpretability, and generalizability. 14.3 Have you dealt with a stakeholder who didn’t trust your model output? What did you do? Yes — this happened during a repeat purchase prediction project. The marketing team was skeptical because some high-value customers were being scored low. I set up a session to walk them through the modeling process and explain key features. Using SHAP, I showed how recent inactivity or smaller purchases could explain the low scores — even for past big spenders. To build confidence, we ran a pilot A/B test using the scores for targeting. I also built simple decision tree summaries to illustrate customer profiles in plain language. After the pilot showed a measurable lift in targeting efficiency, the team became more comfortable and we integrated the model into their audience selection workflow. I learned that transparency + small wins are key to building stakeholder trust. 14.4 Imagine a model is highly accurate but business stakeholders don’t understand it — how do you bridge that gap? I believe a model isn’t useful unless it’s trusted and actionable. In one case, I had an XGBoost model with great metrics, but the stakeholders were overwhelmed by the complexity. So I translated it into two versions: A simplified logistic regression with top 5 features to show directional effects. SHAP-based visuals showing how individual features affected predictions for actual customers. Then I tied predictions to personas they understood — for example, “this group of long-term buyers recently disengaged,” rather than “cluster ID 4.” This combination of technical fidelity + plain language helped them trust the results. I’ve found that mapping outputs to business concepts makes the model feel more like a decision support tool than a black box. 14.5 How would you design a project to measure the lift of a pricing model across different client segments?”** Great question. First, I’d want to clearly define the outcome — are we measuring lift in retention, revenue, or satisfaction post-pricing change? Let’s say retention. I’d begin with randomized A/B testing or, if not feasible, a quasi-experiment using matched segments or propensity score matching. I’d segment clients by size, industry, and service bundle to account for heterogeneity. Each group would have a control group that did not receive the pricing change and a test group that did. Then I’d compute lift as the difference in retention rate (or churn reduction) between control and treatment, possibly using a regression model to adjust for confounders. I’d also include interaction terms in the model to see which segments benefit most. Finally, I’d visualize and summarize results not just statistically, but in terms of business value: “This pricing strategy improves retention by 5% for mid-sized firms in finance, which translates to X million in ARR.” That gives decision-makers a clear, segmented ROI view.

Here’s a structured approach to answering the question: 15.0.1.1 Point Estimation of Population Parameters: Since the sample mean (\\(\\mu\\)) and sample variance (\\(\\sigma^2\\)) are known, they can be used as point estimates for the population mean and variance. However, without knowing the exact distribution, making strong parametric assumptions isn’t possible. The following methods can be applied: Population Mean (\\(\\mu_{pop}\\)): \\[ \\hat{\\mu} = \\mu \\] The sample mean can be used as an unbiased estimator of the population mean, regardless of the underlying distribution. Population Variance (\\(\\sigma^2_{pop}\\)): \\[\\hat{\\sigma}^2 = \\frac{n}{n-1} \\cdot \\sigma^2\\] The sample variance is slightly biased, so a correction factor (Bessel’s correction) is applied to estimate the population variance, assuming the sample is representative of the population. 15.0.1.2 Estimating Uncertainty: To assess uncertainty, particularly around the estimates of the population parameters, confidence intervals (CIs) can be constructed. But given the unknown distribution, parametric approaches (e.g., using the normal distribution) may not apply unless specific assumptions can be made (e.g., using the Central Limit Theorem for large samples). Bootstrap Method: One approach to deal with uncertainty without relying on distributional assumptions is the bootstrap. The bootstrap resamples with replacement from the original data to create many pseudo-samples and then estimates the mean and variance for each resample. This provides an empirical distribution of the estimator, from which confidence intervals can be derived. Steps: Draw multiple (e.g., 1,000 or more) bootstrap samples from the original data. Calculate the sample mean and variance for each bootstrap sample. Use the empirical distribution of these estimates to construct confidence intervals. Confidence Intervals for the Mean: If you can assume that the sample size is large enough (e.g., by the Central Limit Theorem), the sample mean will approximately follow a normal distribution. A confidence interval for the mean can be constructed using: \\[ \\mu \\pm z_{\\alpha/2} \\cdot \\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{n}} \\] where \\(z_{\\alpha/2}\\) is the critical value from the standard normal distribution and \\(n\\) is the sample size. For smaller sample sizes, you could use the t-distribution: \\[ \\mu \\pm t_{\\alpha/2, n-1} \\cdot \\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{n}} \\] where \\(t_{\\alpha/2, n-1}\\) is the critical value from the t-distribution. 15.0.1.3 Nonparametric Approaches: If the distribution remains unknown and nonparametric approaches are preferable: - Use kernel density estimation (KDE) to approximate the population distribution nonparametrically. - Estimate percentiles directly from the sample for population quantiles (e.g., the median). 15.0.1.3.1 Summary Answer: Use the sample mean (\\(\\mu\\)) and adjusted sample variance (\\(\\frac{n}{n-1} \\cdot \\sigma^2\\)) as estimates of the population parameters. Assess uncertainty using methods like bootstrapping for confidence intervals or, if the sample size is large, leverage the Central Limit Theorem to create confidence intervals for the mean.
