# Most Proud Project ‚Äì Influencing Adoption of Balancing Weights

**S ‚Äì Situation**

When I was working on the demographic profile reports, I noticed that some of our panel data sources (like Ibotta receipt sharers) were **skewed**. Younger, budget-conscious groups were overrepresented, which could mislead clients.

At that time, the standard practice across teams was to report **raw results only**, and many colleagues believed that was ‚Äúgood enough.‚Äù

**T ‚Äì Task**

I believed we needed to improve accuracy by applying **balancing weights** ‚Äî but first, I had to convince others to adopt this idea and then design a solution that could scale to large datasets used across multiple departments.

**A ‚Äì Action**

* I ran side-by-side analyses comparing raw vs. weighted results, showing clearly how the raw version exaggerated some demographics.

* Presented the findings to my team, explaining in simple terms how weights aligned the panel closer to Census benchmarks.

* Addressed concerns about complexity by building an **automated weighting process** that could handle big data efficiently.

* Influenced adoption by showing that this wasn‚Äôt just an academic improvement ‚Äî it would directly improve client trust in our insights.

* Set up a **monthly refresh pipeline**, so the weights stayed current and could be reliably used in all projects.

**R ‚Äì Result**

My colleagues and leadership agreed to adopt balancing weights, and it became the **standard methodology across departments** for panel data.

Today, multiple teams use the weights in their reports, and I continue to maintain the refresh process.

I am proud because I not only came up with the idea but also influenced adoption, built the technical solution, and ensured it delivered long-term value.

üëâ Why this version is even stronger:

* **Influence**: you challenged the status quo and got others on board.

* **Think Big**: you turned a one-off fix into a company-wide solution.

* **Ownership**: you built and still maintain the monthly refresh.

* **Deliver Results**: adoption improved accuracy and client confidence.

**Quick Pitch:**

One project I‚Äôm most proud of was introducing balancing weights for our panel data. At first, colleagues resisted, but I showed side-by-side results proving that raw data was skewed and built an automated, scalable process. Today, multiple departments use these weights every month, and I still maintain the refresh ‚Äî it became a company-wide standard that improved accuracy and client trust.
