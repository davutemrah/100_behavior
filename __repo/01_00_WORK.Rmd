## Tell me about a time when you devised a simple solution to a complex problem.

**Context:** At my current company, I worked with large datasets that needed to be balanced to ensure accurate analysis. We needed to create individual-level weights to represent the population properly.

**Challenge:** The datasets were very large, and traditional methods required loading all data into memory, which consumed a lot of resources and took several hours.

**Action:** I developed a SQL query using a post-stratification approach to calculate the individual-level weights. This method dynamically adjusted weights based on demographic variables, making the process simpler and much faster.

**Outcome:** The new query significantly reduced processing time and improved the accuracy of our analysis. It allowed our team to generate more reliable insights and became the standard tool for similar tasks, demonstrating its effectiveness and efficiency.


## How do you resolve conflicts with colleagues?

**Approach:** When resolving conflicts with colleagues, I focus on open communication and understanding. I start by listening to their perspective and concerns without interrupting, which helps me understand their point of view.

**Action:** I then express my own perspective clearly and calmly, focusing on finding common ground. I propose solutions that address both parties' concerns and seek a compromise. If needed, I involve a neutral third party to mediate and ensure the resolution is fair.

**Outcome:** This approach helps to address the conflict constructively and maintains a positive working relationship. By focusing on communication and collaboration, Iâ€™ve successfully resolved conflicts and worked together to achieve our common goals.
