# Behavioral Questions


Here are some tips to help you stay focused during your interviews:

1. **Pause and Listen Fully**: Make sure to let the interviewer finish their question before you start answering. It helps to take a small pause to gather your thoughts.

2. **Practice Brevity**: Try to keep your answers concise. Aim for 2-3 sentences to cover each point, sticking to the most critical information.

3. **Use a Structure**: Use the STAR method (Situation, Task, Action, Result) to keep your answers organized. This can help you stay on track and avoid over-explaining.

4. **Mind Your Pacing**: Speak slowly and clearly. This can help prevent rushing through details and make your points easier to follow.

5. **Check for Understanding**: After your response, ask, "Does that answer your question?" This gives the interviewer a chance to clarify or move on, keeping the conversation balanced.
