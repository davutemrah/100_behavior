### Question:

For a sample with a known mean ($\mu$) and variance ($\sigma^2$) but an unknown distribution, the task is to estimate population parameters and assess uncertainty. Here's a structured approach to answering the question:

#### Point Estimation of Population Parameters:

   Since the sample mean ($\mu$) and sample variance ($\sigma^2$) are known, they can be used as point estimates for the population mean and variance. However, without knowing the exact distribution, making strong parametric assumptions isn't possible. The following methods can be applied:

   - **Population Mean** ($\mu_{pop}$): 
     $$
     \hat{\mu} = \mu
     $$
     The sample mean can be used as an unbiased estimator of the population mean, regardless of the underlying distribution.

   - **Population Variance** ($\sigma^2_{pop}$): 
     
     $$\hat{\sigma}^2 = \frac{n}{n-1} \cdot \sigma^2$$
     The sample variance is slightly biased, so a correction factor (Bessel's correction) is applied to estimate the population variance, assuming the sample is representative of the population.

#### Estimating Uncertainty:
   
   To assess uncertainty, particularly around the estimates of the population parameters, confidence intervals (CIs) can be constructed. But given the unknown distribution, parametric approaches (e.g., using the normal distribution) may not apply unless specific assumptions can be made (e.g., using the Central Limit Theorem for large samples).

   - **Bootstrap Method**: 
   
     One approach to deal with uncertainty without relying on distributional assumptions is the **bootstrap**. The bootstrap resamples with replacement from the original data to create many pseudo-samples and then estimates the mean and variance for each resample. This provides an empirical distribution of the estimator, from which confidence intervals can be derived.

     **Steps**:
     1. Draw multiple (e.g., 1,000 or more) bootstrap samples from the original data.
     2. Calculate the sample mean and variance for each bootstrap sample.
     3. Use the empirical distribution of these estimates to construct confidence intervals.

   - **Confidence Intervals for the Mean**: 
     If you can assume that the sample size is large enough (e.g., by the Central Limit Theorem), the sample mean will approximately follow a normal distribution. A confidence interval for the mean can be constructed using:
     $$
     \mu \pm z_{\alpha/2} \cdot \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}
     $$
     where $z_{\alpha/2}$ is the critical value from the standard normal distribution and $n$ is the sample size.

     For smaller sample sizes, you could use the **t-distribution**:
     $$
     \mu \pm t_{\alpha/2, n-1} \cdot \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}
     $$
     where $t_{\alpha/2, n-1}$ is the critical value from the t-distribution.

#### Nonparametric Approaches:

   If the distribution remains unknown and nonparametric approaches are preferable:
   - Use **kernel density estimation (KDE)** to approximate the population distribution nonparametrically.
   - Estimate percentiles directly from the sample for population quantiles (e.g., the median).

##### Summary Answer:

- Use the sample mean ($\mu$) and adjusted sample variance ($\frac{n}{n-1} \cdot \sigma^2$) as estimates of the population parameters.

- Assess uncertainty using methods like bootstrapping for confidence intervals or, if the sample size is large, leverage the Central Limit Theorem to create confidence intervals for the mean.
